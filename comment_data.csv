A week ago I built a new rig with a 7800X3D and a 7800XT. I’ve only got 1080p monitors so it’s definitely overkill, but there’s nothing like being able to crank most games to max settings and get 100+ fps (300+ in PUBG, cranked) I also play a lot of Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane which are both highly CPU bound and the 3D v-cache rips them to shreds. Especially with MSFS, I find myself being GPU bound in a surprising number of cases.

I have had a few crashes, but those were remedied with BIOS and driver updates. It’s been rock solid since then. I’m sure it could do even better with the right overclock.",ManyPandas,24,AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D,Processor,2023-11-11 17:01:47

k8vw2o9,t3_17synze,"As a system programmer I can say that cpu memory latency is about 100-200cycles if not more. Memory is really fucking slow, cpu can do like 500 instructions worth of computation in same time as waiting for one memory access. Thats why we have 2 threads per core, so one uses core computation resources while other is waiting for data from memory. If main part of data fits in cache boost is huge. Its actually an art to write algorithms that are cache friendly, because when data is loaded from memory its loaded 64bytes at a time, even if you need one, so if you pack data that used together then its faster. Simplified example would be like hp and ammo counter, if you place them together then when one loaded when displaing them then another one is definitely in cache and no additional memory access is needed. And also cpus have predictors that recognize some access patterns and some dumb algorithms like searching array by probing each item sequentially may work better than more complex ones that randomly access memory, just because cpu preloads next memory part into cache while its read, just like with ssd sequential read is faster",MassiveAd3759,3,AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D,Processor,2023-11-11 17:01:47

kct3fbo,t3_18f5j13,"1: the 5800x3D and 7800x3D are significantly underestimated. It's bizarre to me how many people still think they are over-rated and terrible value, just the other day had a guy that insisted the 5800x or 7700x were vastly superior value and performed better, because in plenty of cases average frame rates could be higher. ""average frame rates"" being the most ridiculously useless metric by todays standards, honestly reviewers need to dump this crap metric, we've had for years now better ones, 1% and 0.1% lows combined with frame pacing graphs tells it all and should be prioritized.

2: Damn straight they are efficient, easy on the power demands, sure they get a bit spicy but that cache isn't helping matter acting as an insulator. ""why bother"" undervolting? Because out of the box, you can get better thermals and performance by doing the most minimal amount of effort using curve optimizer. 5800x3Ds generally do have a habit of accepting -30 all core and seeing an improvement in performance while also a dramatic reduction in temps. 7800x3D... bit of a greater range in the negative curve. But i've seen as low as 50 watts and very reasonable temperatures with a noticable improvement in peak performance. If anything should ensure a potentially longer life with less extreme swings.

3: Pretty much no one NEEDS AIO in the vast majority of cases, At this point in time, we've enough variety in proper heatsink that the only reason to go AIO, is exclusively for cosmetic appearances, there's no other advantage unless you've simply no way to mount a sufficiently large enough heatsink. But yes, you don't necessarily need a behemoth of a heatsink. Even AMD's Wraith Prism heatsink is capable of handling the thermal load of the 5800x3D with the curve optimizer at -30. It's all about the capacity of the heatsink you use (it's total thermal capabilities) and how efficiently it can swing that heat up into itself, and then move sufficient air to get rid of it fast enough to keep up. Some people think they need the biggest AIO/liquid rad setup, when fundamentally it's absolutely asinine, clearly individuals that don't get how there is a point where extra capacity does nothing but delay equilibrium which doesn't benifit anyone anyways. ""but it means things stay cooler longer..."" doesn't help anything in this manner. You can't defy thermal dynamics.

4: the 5800x3D isn't actually that power hungry as i said.... granted that with a curve optimization in place, it's a little power chewy at stock, but still not terrible for what you get. 5800x3D is 2nd to only the 7800x3D...

5: As it'll be said, the 7900x3d and 7950x3d can provide better performance than the 7800x3D... so they should be mentioned rather than left in a vacuum, but lets all be honest, there are still hiccups dealing with it and reviews still show those hiccups still ongoing. IMO until amd launches a 12 or 16 core single CCD 3D solution or they are better able to manage how dual/nth level number of CCDs, without any of these hiccups occuring at all, the rule remains that it's best for most people to just pick up a 7800x3D (or 5800x3D if they have an existing AM4 platform or want to get something a fair bit more affordable that's still 2nd best).",DHJudas,5,AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D,Processor,2023-12-10 15:05:59

No, you probably don't *need* it since a 13600k or 7700 can be gotten for way cheaper and have good enough performance for anything but 1080p low settings with a 4090.  Anything less than a $2000 budget machine (or I guess if you fucking *love* factorio) you probably don't need it.

You can get a 7700X + motherboard + 32GB of DDR5-6000 RAM at microcenter for $500 total in a combo deal. It's hard to justify $450 for *just* a CPU compared to that for fairly minor gains at 1440p/4k if budget is at all a concern.",Brostradamus_,72,AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D,Processor,2023-04-05 14:16:04

The 14900K water-cooled and I use multiple profiles depending on what I want to do. One is an all-core OC, another is TVB +2 bins, and lastly stock with a slight undervolt. on a Z790 Nova running 7600CL36 with tuned subtimings. 

Both stock, 7800X3D easily my recommendation. Even if you turn on or off Intel's power limits than every motherboard seems to ignore by default for some reason.

Only gaming (VRR/FPS limit and no tinkering) - Once again 7800X3D all day long.

Only gaming (Fixed Refresh/Competitive/Overtly sensitive to latency AND/OR willing to tinker or enjoy tinkering) - 14900K

Productivity over 50% of your computer usage - 14900K

I'm not a competitive gamer by any stretch, but I do prefer having the smoothest, most low latency experience. I also enjoy tinkering with my system just as much if not more than playing the games themselves. I was also interested in using the big.LITTLE architecture, having experimented with it a lot in the mobile space with ARM-based chips. Those are the reasons I shifted to the 14900K in my main system after having only using Ryzen for the past few years. Despite the 7800X3D having the highest peak FPS number.

In other words, for most ""normal"" gamers or PC enthusiasts, the 7800X3D is easily the winner here, especially if you only care about peak FPS numbers. However, if you're someone that enjoys seeing all the different ways you can get more out of your hardware, I'd recommend the 14900K. I have to say I agree with der8aur, in one his recent videos he commented how he wishes AMD would unlock the frequency of 7800X3D and how it's crazy that Intel has been more friendly to overclocking recently.

If youre just gaming the 7800X3D is the best processor out there. The 7700x hangs out there on that second tier below it with other CPUs like the 12900k, the 13600k, 14600k, and the 5800X3D. It also keeps up to the 13700k somewhat although I would put that in a middle tier between the 7800X3D and the others. 

The 13900k and 14900k are also a little faster than thr 13700k/14700k but also below the 7800X3D. I would largely consider them not worth buying for gaming. 12900k isnt either UNLESS you are considering a microcenter deal where it goes head to head with the 7700x for the same price, and performs roughly the same on average. At that point it's just your brand preference. 

But yeah. NO other gaming CPU touches the 7800X3D. Because that top tier below it has so many CPUs that all perform within a percent of each other. And the 7800X3D is a souped up version of one of those. 

My only leeriness with AM5 as a platform is the fact that there still seem to be RAM stability issues with certain motherboard/RAM configurations (see: microcenter bundles). Other than that, you cant beat the 7800X3D though in value.

* Use common sense - if the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* Check seller profiles for signs that the sale may be fraudulent. 
    * The seller is new or has few reviews. 
    * The seller has largely negative reviews (on Amazon, sellers can remove negative reviews from their ratings- viewing seller profiles allows you to see these complaints) 
    * The seller has a recently reactivated account (likely their account was hacked and is now being used fraudulently). 

If you suspect a deal is fraudulent, please report the post. Moderators can take action based on these reports. We encourage leaving a comment to warn others. 

Amazon and eBay generally have good buyer protection. If you choose to purchase from a third-party seller through their platforms and run into issues, it should be easy to get your money back promptly. You may have more difficulties with Newegg or Walmart.

jsgigfw,t3_152zq1a,"A few suggestions to get better performance and better cooling for a little less cost.

* **CPU**:  The 12600K actually performs slightly better than the 13400F for less cost currently (see [this Techpowerup review with gaming benchmarks](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i5-13400f/17.html))
* **CPU Cooler**:  The Thermalright Peerless Assassin is a far better cooler than the stock one on the 13400F, plus the 12600K does not come with a cooler.  It will easily cool the 12600K without issues.
* **Motherboard**:  Less expensive motherboard with wifi and bluetooth - plus the 12600K can be used with the B660 chipset without a BIOS update.
* **Memory**:  Faster speed RAM for less cost.
* **Storage**:  Better spec 1TB PCIe 4 NVME drive for less cost.
* **Video Card**:  Upgraded to a 3070 that is actually slighly less expensive than the 3060 Ti and will provide better performance across the board, at both 1080p and 1440p.
* **Case**:  Much less expensive case still with very good airflow - two 140mm fans included on the front, plus an added 120mm fan for the rear as exhaust.
* **Power Supply**:  Better quality unit (Tier A vs Tier B for the Asus) for less cost currently.

Explanation of changes:  
\- Ryzen 5600 is a great budget gaming CPU and is more balanced for this build  
\- Also, for Intel the stock cooler is not good at all, for AMD, specifically with the 5000 series it is very capable  
\- You really shouldn't spend more than $150 on a motherboard, this one may have less features but it's capable  
\- Just went with a cheaper version of RAM that is the exact same  
\- Same for SSD  
\- The 3060ti is not a good choice for 1440p at all, if your main interest is gaming NVIDIA just shouldn't be your pick at this price point. The 6800xt is an actual 1440p GPU, and even then, if you need to downgrade to a 6700xt that would still offer better 1440p performance than the 3060ti can.   
\- Case looks cool, but you need more fans, went with one with more pre-installed  
\- Cheaper but more reliable PSU",KishCore,1,Intel Core i5 13400F,Processor,2023-07-18 14:17:10

For a so called i5 model, it performs nothing like one, I’m fairly sure that this was the very model that caused Intel to officially announce that they were going to use a new model naming scale, because this CPU no longer lined up with what each model was supposed to be capable of.

Even if you pair this thing with a 4090 vs a 13900k and 4090, at 1080p which is the worst case scenario for the CPU, the 13900k only averages about 7% more performance, and lets be honest, the 13900k is just a savage in comparison, so that is seriously high praise for the 13600k for gamers.

I’ve played around lightly with a very basic overclock, which only consisted with nothing more than changing the multiplier so the P cores were at 5.4ghz and the E cores at 4.2ghz, no cache change, no additional voltage or anything fancy, and i gained almost 10% of additional performance in Cinebench straight up. 

It just has so much potential, it undervolts more than the i7 and i9, and from what I’ve seen, you can gain up to 20% overall performance through overclocking and bring the P cores to something like 6.1ghz, which is just insane, honestly worth every cent.",JTG-92,22,Intel Core i5 13600K,Processor,2023-11-09 05:31:45

jr9j72s,t3_14uvimg,"Both the Intel Core i5-13600K and the Intel Core i7-12700F are capable processors, but they have some differences in terms of core count, thread count, and features. Let's compare them in the context of video editing, graphic design, 3D rendering, animation, and occasional gaming:

1. Core i5-13600K:

* Cores: 6 cores, 12 threads
* Architecture: Intel Raptor Lake
* Power Efficiency: Hybrid architecture with performance cores (P-cores) and efficiency cores (E-cores)
* Clock Speed: Base clock speed of 3.6 GHz, boost clock speed of 4.8 GHz
* Graphics: Integrated Intel Xe Graphics (12th generation)
* Overclocking: Unlocked multiplier for potential overclocking

The Core i5-13600K is a capable processor with a good balance between performance and price. Its 6 P-cores and 12 threads make it suitable for video editing, graphic design, 3D rendering, and animation tasks. It should handle these tasks reasonably well, especially if you're not doing them professionally or on a large scale. The integrated graphics can also come in handy for occasional gaming.

1. Core i7-12700F:

* Cores: 8 cores, 16 threads
* Architecture: Intel Alder Lake
* Power Efficiency: Hybrid architecture with performance cores (P-cores) and efficiency cores (E-cores)
* Clock Speed: Base clock speed of 3.6 GHz, boost clock speed of 5.0 GHz
* Graphics: No integrated graphics
* Overclocking: Not mentioned

The Core i7-12700F is a more powerful processor with 8 P-cores and 16 threads, providing better multitasking capabilities. It lacks integrated graphics, which means you'll need a dedicated graphics card for display output and gaming. If you're primarily focused on professional tasks like video editing, graphic design, 3D rendering, and animation, the additional cores and threads of the i7-12700F can offer better performance and productivity.

Considering your use cases involving video editing, graphic design, 3D rendering, and animation, I would lean towards recommending the Core i7-12700F. The higher core and thread count will benefit these tasks, allowing for smoother multitasking and faster processing. However, if occasional gaming is a significant consideration for you, the i5-13600K's integrated graphics might be useful, although it's worth noting that integrated graphics are generally not suitable for demanding AAA games.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on your specific needs, budget, and availability in your region. It may also be beneficial to compare the prices and availability of compatible motherboards for each processor to ensure you have suitable options for your build.",milliondollarguys,2,Intel Core i5 13600K,Processor,2023-07-09 10:47:53

It's kind of strange it took them this long to discover it to me.

CPU is usually shown during the boot process. You can see it in various system info dialogs, various debug screens in games and other software... Even the Task Manager. This isn't like the GPU swap where they actually change the DeviceID so the driver assigns the wrong device name. It's kinda wild they never noticed. 

Additionally: This is literally all based on just a reddit post. We've got some pictures of an i9 and some CPU-Z screenshots. Not even a write up. And the ubiquitous photo of the bottom of a heatsink, for some reason.

Of course, what is described can and probably does happen. But it's unclear why that reddit post was enough to create a article. Wouldn't be hard for anybody to make the same ""evidence"" that's been presented here anyway.

Love how some photos and screenshots and two comments- ""No it was not used I paid £585 for it in April from Amazon"" and ""I bought it direct from amazon new"" is enough to justify an article.

aio  - be quite 360 silent loop 

thermal paste - thermal grizzly kryonaut 

In my case fix was these two steps:

1. Airflow, front fans were installed in the wrong direction (exhaust), in my case should be intake
2. Re-pasted cpu, added more thermal paste (this time i used Gelid).

after that change I got \~30 in bios, during load sometimes the package can spike to 100 but compared to the previous time it's a rare case now. 

Once i got these results i decided also to undervolt my cpu, just -0.1V power offset, do a very big change, now during gaming or work i have stable \~70 not more, and its much quieter with the same level of performance.

jqsqr58,t3_14rceeq,"Frankly, I'd go as far as suggesting that if a person can't explain why they need a CPU like 13900k over 13700k, they overwhelmingly likely don't need it.  


It's only meaningfully faster in notoriously multi-threaded throughput oriented (non-real time) applications and use cases, those are few and far between and in my limited experience folks who use those and aren't satisfied with the performance of a CPU with a more moderate core count in those applications tend to simply know it very well it and knowingly pursue the highest core count part for their budget.  


In case of 13900k in particular, however, it stops being just about likely wasting money and goes further. The thing is a headache to cool. No, one doesn't actually need an expensive cooler or AIO that dries out in 5 years and needs replacement, or loud fan curves for it if the most multi-threaded app they ever use with it is a game, and no one ever actually needs to keep their modern CPU much below manufacturer specified thermal limits (100 C in case of Intel's 13th gen), but not blowing money on cooling and not blowing one's ears with noise requires knowing the above, which is unlikely to happen in practice, and even then fan curves are unlikely to work well out of the box and most likely will require time consuming tuning to have good noise characteristics and actually make sense.  


Basically, unless you know what 13900k is and why you need it, it's a waste of money, waste of time, possibility of unnecessarily self-inflicted anxiety about temps and ""not getting all of the performance"" \[in synthetic benchmarks only\] FOMO, and inferior system noise characteristics.",rorschach200,18,Intel Core i9 13900K,Processor,2023-07-05 14:34:06

For Farcry 6 the 12900KS is 2.68% faster than the 12900K. This claims the 13900ks is 3.25% faster than the 12900K, so it ends up only being 0.57% faster?

So the extra cache and IPC only amount to <1% average FPS gains in these games? And both leaks and Intel have said double digit ST gains (10%+), obviously synthetics dont translate directly into gaming performance but I wouldve expected the difference to be a bit higher.

But maybe these games are just at their limits. Looking at the 5800x3D data, FC6, Horizon, and RDR2 perform the same on the 5800x3D as they do on the 12900KS.

It will be doing both the extra Ram and SSD plus multiple soundcards to run multiple interfaces, coolant system, lighting, two soundboards together with one at 64 channels and the other to add more channels. On the analog side an entire front end with preamps, amps, synths, microphones, sequencer, converters, and so forth. It goes on. Basically dividing it into a part analog and part digital setup with several softwares for different stages of production, mixing and mastering as well as a separate line that will be the analog i/o with a reel to reel option at the end as well as. With what I am working towards a laptop ain't cutting it anymore for me. I started in analog and got into digital and now 360ing back into a hybrid setup. It basically comes down to a decent processor for me and a motherboard that has tons of slots.

Edit: People have pointed out that the jump from Zen 2 to 3 was actually fairly large which I guess is true. I was more thinking about it from the aspect of both lines being on the same architecture and process node only more optimized and refined which is supposedly what 13th gen would be. Maybe a performance jump more in line of Intel 9th to 10th or 10th to 11th gen would be more accurate when talking about potential gains that 13th gen will have.

iq2j84o,t3_xoj3lm,"So a couple things here and one of the problems I have with CPU testing right now. It is not a hypothetical to think that Nvidia and AMD will both be releasing GPUs into the future. That means there will always be GPU scaling going forward. It's not a scenario that wont happen. We could make a argument for Intels next generation of GPUs showing up, but in the case of the Nvidia and AMD, they will most definitely be releasing a next generation of GPUs. The future will be there tomorrow, we aren't operating in a simulator and hardware review websites should operate not only under the idea of giving you the best value today, but the best value in three years. While there aren't nearly as many people on a two year upgrade cycle as four year upgrade cycle, it is completely realistic to assume that someone will still be running the same CPU in 4 years when they buy a new shiny 5000 series GPU.

I get that you guys like going back to the '4 cores is alright and 6 cores is definitely going to get you by', but it's not realistic for a forward looking scenario. The sun isn't going to explode tomorrow, the world isn't going to end, there will 99.9% likely be the 5000 series from Nvidia and the 8000 series from AMD in 3 years. Operating under that premise, CPU bound scenarios, when testing CPUs should always be of utmost importance. Most importantly using resolution scaling first and foremost, rather then reducing graphical preset, as this best simulates a high end GPU or a next gen GPU.

The second interesting thing here is how not enough emphasis has been added to coolers. While it was talked about it mattering at the beginning of the video, the real kicker here is the trade off between cooler size, performance, and efficiency. A very interesting metric that could've been added here is the size of a cooler in a normal PC case Vs performance of these chips. There will be a diminishing return on this. So a 360mm radiator might not perform much better then a DH-15, but cost a lot more and of course take up more space. This very much butts heads with how overclocking works now, where people basically set arbitrary voltage or temperature limitations and will ramp up to it, AMD has taken that out of the equation. Where they set the temperature limitation and ramp up to it. This also means the chip will more then likely get more efficient with a smaller cooler, as the CPU senses it's pre-emptively running into a temperature bottleneck and reduces voltage to become more efficient, as is the case if you set a overclocking temperature threshold. So a smaller cooler may improve efficiency at the expense of frequency.

That would've been a very interesting comparative piece, showcasing different size coolers and their impact on performance and efficiency of the chip, as well as pricing and feasibility of having a larger cooler in a case.

Now the last bit, while CPU and GPU bound scenarios were mentioned, there needs to be more emphasis be added to which of these bottlenecks it's running into. I assume GN and HUB both have tools open in the background to monitor it, we as viewers can't see this and figure out whether or not it matters to us. It gives you a idea of why certain games will perform and scale much better then others. Seeing GPU utilization, as well as overall system CPU utilization and then the top utilized core, or just a utilization graph like task manager would help immensely make decisions on what they're purchasing.",bensam1231,329,AMD Ryzen 9 7950X,Processor,2022-09-26 13:19:29

How much power do they consume? **As much as the user wants it to**.

> In the single-threaded test with CineBench R23, we only saw a drop of around 0.3%, which is negligible depending on the workload.

And that is the result of 7950x @ 65 W. With lightly threaded programs, and many game are like that, it's about the same performance at much lower power consumption. **But the CPU temp is still at the same 95C target**.

Of course, if you need and want AVX multi-core performance, yeah, it can go with workstation-style workloads to mid 200 W. *If that is what the users want*.

Sadly, that was not properly explained by the AMD marketing team, and we have what we have, a lot of people getting to rush conclusions that Zen 4 is ""intel performance with intel powerconsumption"".

Needless to say, when the competition is much more potent in the marketing game, AMD has low chances of success. Which is reflected in the history of users again and again preferring the competition even when ""team red"" had rather solid products (there are other factors at play, but this one IMO is important too).

Top tier mobos are generally either for lots of IO options, or competitive overclocking. *Without* Eco Mode, you can get $250 boards that will do the job well, and have good feature sets. Even cheaper might work out. VRMs matter, but only relative to the use case. For anything but competitive overclocking, there will be a point where they're good enough.

Likewise, air coolers are good enough, even without Eco mode. 90% of the time, AIOs are for aesthetics.

Outside of needing add-on goodies, I personally prefer MicroATX sans-PSU-shroud (or with with a net/mesh top on the shroud). Cooling straight front to back is really simple, there's less wasted space, and it's easier to tweak cooling.

The GPU is in the ballpark of pre-Xe Intel IGP, but with better drivers. Not good for gaming, but plenty for web and office type usage.

You really should have made a few threads, here, first, for the general build. This is not a brand new phenomenon.

I did this with my 8700K back in a day. It started as underclocked but with AIO. Then some years later I put it on liquid metal and cranked overclocking to max. It definitely gave second breath to the system that otherwise would be just replaced. Gained me another year, even though money was not an issue.

Two specific things I would note about your list, though I know you weren't asking for advice:  
1.) Get comfortable with the BIOS, get comfortable with updating it. There are a series of things that should be set in every install (above 4g decoding, UEFI, EXPO/XMP, fan curves, resizable BAR support, CSM, TPM set to firmware instead of discrete unless you have one, etc) that I suspect a lot of newbies don't realize should be changed from their defaults. When you update BIOS, reload optimized defaults every time and re-do your changes as needed.  


2.) PBO isn't something you just ""turn on"" for free performance and call it a day. I really encourage you to dig into how to utilize it and stability test properly. I would also recommend against diving into that at all if you're encountering crashes at this stage. You shouldn't be having any.",[deleted],3,AMD Ryzen 9 7950X,Processor,2023-04-29 16:55:58

You can always wait forever for the next big thing, then get bitten by early adopter tax, first gen instabilities, etc.

It can selectively boost a core(s) to 5.85ghz. AMD didn't list the max as 5.85ghz so it wouldn't be slammed in marketing, but if the cpu is cool it can boost to 5.85ghz for a short burst. Thats cool. 

I heard a rumor which I cannot confirm that ryzen actually runs more efficient cooler so it boosts easier a lower temps also. Heat causes resistance to change in metals, (maybe silicon also? Not sure) so this maybe also going on.

I also heard they like to run hot which some people are having fits over. If the chip is well made and the psu is good most of the time in my opinion the motherboard is the weak link or ram. I have a phenom II from roughly 14ish years ago that got run hard. Still could boot it up a few months ago before I evicted if from the case.

tldr

1. 7950x at 65w eco mode outperforms 12900k in cbr23 mt by 5% while drawing 160w less (~140w in anandtech review, but +16% perf over 12900k)
2. There are some variances in 65w eco mode performance, pcworld hit 28655 but [anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17585/amd-zen-4-ryzen-9-7950x-and-ryzen-5-7600x-review-retaking-the-high-end/20) hit 31308 (+10% perf). Probably due to cooling, board, and bin differences
3. 7950x at 105w eco mode loses ~10% perf compared to 7950x in cbr23 for 100w decrease in power (this number averages out to a lower perf loss of 5+% across other mt workloads according to other reviews)
4. [Computerbase](https://www.computerbase.de/2022-09/amd-ryzen-7950x-7900x-7700x-7600x-test/2/#abschnitt_effizienz_bei_reduzierter_tdp_inkl_ecomode) found that the 7950x matches the 5950x perf at around half the power, 65w **ppt** vs 142w **ppt** (133w adjusted for same performance)
5. Same st perf regardless of power limit (which is expected)

Amd pushed the 7950x into overclocked levels at stock which made it look inefficient, 100+w increase in power all just for a 5+% mt gain. It's actually real efficient if you'd lower the clocks by a few % or limit its power

Currently have an R7 5800X, RTX 3080, 3000mhz CL15 ddr4 16gb RAM.

These parts are all plugged onto a MSI B450 Tomahawk (not Max) which means any RAM upgrade is negligible due to only being able to achieve 3466 mhz capped by my board, but i've read that the 3d chips don't care too much about fast RAM.

I have so many stutters and drops that piss me off that I really want to upgrade but I have yoyo'd back and forth so hard whether to go for 5800x3D, essentially a side-grade for £273 or do a full AM5 upgrade and get a 7800x3D for £573ish

I just don't know what to do. Every thread and video i watch has different conclusions: i'm a moron for even considering going from a 5800x to a 5800x3D but then many people report massive improvements in stability / 1% lows which is what i would be primarily upgrading for.

I'm also a moron for even considering doing a full upgrade for one generation higher with the 7800x3D even though on tons of benchmark videos the fps increase and lows above the 5800x3D are insane and I would feel very comfortable with the peace of mind knowing i have the top shit.

kgod7j4,t3_190gezb,"Absolutely unlimited budget? Personally I would pay for someone to do custom watercooling at that point, but if that’s not up your wheelhouse then I got you. Here you go man. The best gaming PC made of widely available parts that money can buy. Now pair it with a $99 1080p 75hz monitor and make us all cry.

Note: technically the motherboard is only a “great” choice performance-wise, not the “best” choice, but it won’t actually affect gaming in any way (it still has upgraded audio) and it looks amazing and when spending this kind of money looks matter.

I’ll also add that this is not a “smart” purchase. Many of the components could be replaced with something cheaper with little to no performance difference. But without considering price, and without considering custom parts, this is about the best you can get.

The low power consumption of the 5800x3d is attractive. Won’t make too much heat. I have a gaming desk setup in my apartment’s walk in closet. Even with my fan/air purifier, the less heat the better. 

I also just want the cheapest 3080 you can get. I am interested in crypto too so there is the bonus in that it can also mine. I don’t plan on making any serious money with mining lol, but it’s be nice to dabble in it. The 3080 will for sure be mainly just for gaming though. I don’t think proof of work is going away that soon. And while I really want to upgrade to the new gen parts coming late this year, I really don’t want to be that early adopter of a new platform stuck troubleshooting. The plan is to upgrade a year into the new platform (think post raptor lake/ryzen zen 5 8000 series cpu paired with a monster rtx 5000 series/RX 8000 series gpu) once it has matured and really improved performance big time. At that point, this 5800x3d and rtx 3080 fe sff build would have mined some nice eth/other coins to help pay for the new build, but could also then be used as a LAN party computer, little miner if there still is a profitable coin to mine, and/or as a streamer pc (if I decide I’d like to do that sort of thing 🤷‍♂️).

Edit: I do plan on getting a 5120 x 1440 p monitor for my setup. So maybe the gaming performance improvement won’t matter. I plan on playing planetside 2 which is notoriously cpu bound game. But even with that I wonder if it will be cpu bound at that resolution 🤔

Its pretty similar with 6900xt both products are in no mans land, its neither good price to performance and its not the best either. very slight regression in productivity apps (as expected) and very hit or miss in gaming. Sure in games like fc5 and borderlands 3 the perf is amazing but in other games its not that much different to a 12700k or its normal 5800x version, in csgo its even a regression. So it seems that esport games are not its strongest suit where you could make an argument (esports market is quite big as well) hmm i think its pretty clear that 12700k is a better all round cpu at better price.

I personally always lean towards better ""all rounder"" cpus, but some gaming results are very nice with 5800x3d.

But the pricing though, just proves to me more how such bad value of a product it really is...

To put it on perspective, the real contender that Alder Lake line up has against this is the i7 12700KF or even just 12700F if you don't care about OCing not the 12900K, because that is a bad value product in the first place, that is much more expensive compared to it's brothers for like what 3% performance increase?

And if you compare 5800X3D to them they are much cheaper, while still achieving pretty much near identical performance, especially if you play at realistic resolution.

Also this 5800X3D starts to go even further showing how bad value really it is against it's own line up, the Ryzen 7 5700X for example is a much cheaper one or heavily discounted Ryzen 7 5800X, they are only 10% slower at best case scenario at 720p resolution, again if you play at realistic resolution and graphics settings, they are pretty much identical.

If i am a AMD user that is currently on upgrade path right now, i would rather get myself a Ryzen 7 5700X, because i refuse to spend near 50% more money over just 10% performance uplift, at 720p, which is a resolution i am never going to play at. in real case scenario, it is literally identical performance...

The 5800X3D as i expected, is pretty much a very niche CPU aimed for AMD users only that wants the best gaming performance they can squeeze out of their AM4 platform, but doesn't give a damn about price to performance, because it is so expensive that it makes no sense to get it over a 5700X,

but the thing is even with this assumption, it won't age as well because Zen 4 is already around the corner, and i already expect Zen 4 will be crushing this later this year, so, even if i am a guy who spends limitless money on my PC, and wants the best of the best...

In gaming it's faster than the 5800x by 8-10% but at $450 it's not a great value. The 12700k is only 2% slower...

It seems like this is a pretty conditional buy:

 If you already own AM4, and already have a flagship GPU (3080 or better) and game at 1080p and are looking to upgrade solely for gaming performance, the 5800x3D is a reasonable choice, the 5700x/5800x is a better value and the 5900x is better for productivity.

 If you're a new builder, the 12700F for $310 or 12700k for $375 gets you basically identical gaming performance (without OC), and much better multithreaded performance for cheaper. Hell even the $270 12600k has identical productivity performance and is only 4-5% slower in games, but if you overclock (which the 5800x3D can't) it's going to be near identical performance.

i4graun,t3_u25loj,"**>""Things look different when it comes to gaming. It seems that games are an ideal workload for higher cache sizes, which is probably why AMD has been shipping their Ryzen processors with relatively large caches (compared to Intel), even though cache takes up a lot of silicon die area, which costs money. Averaged over our 10 games at the CPU-bottlenecked 720p resolution, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D can gain an impressive 10% in performance over its 5800X counterpart. This is enough to make it the fastest gaming CPU, right behind Intel Core i9-12900K and i9-12900KS. Considering that Intel's Alder Lake comes with a new and improved core architecture, runs almost 1 GHz higher and has faster DDR5 memory, this is an impressive achievement. It also means that Intel has defended their ""World's fastest Gaming Processor"" claim, but the differences are minimal, when looking at the averages. Individual games will show vastly different results though, the highlights here are Borderlands 3 and Far Cry 5. Borderlands 3, which has been extremely CPU limited in all our testing gains an enormous 43% (!!) in FPS. Far Cry 5 is the most memory-sensitive title in our test suite, +35%, wow! The rest of our games do gain some FPS, but the differences aren't as big. You're probably wondering why Counter-Strike CS:GO is only 5% faster. I suspect it's because the game's hot data already fits into the cache of most processors, so the larger L3 cache doesn't have as much an effect.""**

> I also tried adjusting the base clock from 100 MHz to 103 MHz, but that didn't even POST.

I find it a little interesting that it can't even be underclocked. I'm not exactly sure why anyone buying a chip like this would necessarily want to manually set a lower all-core underclock, but it's interesting that it just ignores any changes, even downward.

And, as for the BCLK not POSTing at 103MHz, isn't that partially just related to how X570 boards just in general don't like BCLK overclocking that much (because they were using an MSI X570 board)? It would be interesting to see it on a B550 board, since those tend to tolerate a lot more BCLK than X570 in my experience.",yee245,5,AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D,Processor,2022-04-12 18:16:01

In the end the performance difference between both in the most CPU-bound games (720p) was under 5% and if they had been fair and also used high-end B-Die DDR4-3600 CL14 not only would the memory still have been cheaper but I'm pretty sure it would've been enough to have it go from being a minor loss to a very small victory (under 5%) vs the 12900KS.

In productivity and workstation tasks, it's sometimes faster and sometimes slower than the 5800x, but basically always slower than the 12700k. This was expected though.

In gaming it's faster than the 5800x by 8-10% but at $450 it's not a great value. The 12700k is only 2% slower...

It seems like this is a pretty conditional buy:

 If you already own AM4, and already have a flagship GPU (3080 or better) and game at 1080p and are looking to upgrade solely for gaming performance, the 5800x3D is a reasonable choice, the 5700x/5800x is a better value and the 5900x is better for productivity.

 If you're a new builder, the 12700F for $310 or 12700k for $375 gets you basically identical gaming performance (without OC), and much better multithreaded performance for cheaper. Hell even the $270 12600k has identical productivity performance and is only 4-5% slower in games, but if you overclock (which the 5800x3D can't) it's going to be near identical performance.",Put_It_All_On_Blck,-23,AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D,Processor,2022-04-12 18:16:01

i14cj9k,t3_tg5v1l,"At the end of the day, all that matters is the performance in the apps/games you use. Either it fares better or it doesn't. It's basically a beta product I think it's cool they are actually releasing it as it would have been easy to just cancel it.

Reminds me of Intel releasing the socketed Broadwells with EDRAM -- when used as L4 cache they made for the best VR CPUs until very recently due to high minimum frame times. Also still one of the best APUs until very recently. But they didn't clock as high as Devil's Canyon or score as high for average frame rate so everybody hated on them and Intel killed off socketed EDRAM CPUs. I still rock 5775Cs in my 2 (now dedicated) VR machines. They still have better minimums on several VR games vs my 5900X. I expect this CPU to finally be the one that replaces it.

Benchmarks are inherently flawed in that completely ignore the most important real-world result: consistency. Because we put so much importance on benchmarks, companies now design products heavily around performing well on benchmarks. As they have to! I don't expect this CPU to melt faces off on average frame rate in every game and the reduced clock speeds will be the talk of the town. The product will probably be panned & considered a failure.

But I'll bet you it has the best minimum frame times in the business for the foreseeable future. Who cares if I'm getting 500fps when my display is 4k/144hz? But I care when suddenly drop to 30fps briefly and feel a hitch because we had to pull something down from the system RAM. It's especially important in VR where consistent frame rates are needed to prevent motion sickness & a few low frames can ruin immersion pretty quickly. Or if a couple very noticeable hiccups can be avoided to smooth things out, that's important for both experience & competitive gaming. Clock speeds are all plenty fast and on average capable of feeding frames a lot faster than today's best GPUs can even handle at the resolutions we usually use. But the clock speed isn't much of a factor when data has to be retrieved from RAM after cache misses.

It's like the companies that brag about their average salary when their CEO makes $20 million and their 100 underlings are making $10/hour. Average frame rate is becoming an almost useless statistic -- especially when you consider the GPU bottlenecks that erase it completely.",Gianfarte,1,AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D,Processor,2022-03-17 09:01:14

I feel like the problem is that there's too much CPU paired with this iGPU. If they could cut it down to a 4-core CPU with the same 12-core GPU and then cut the price by $100, then this would be a compelling product. Remember the Zen+ APUs with 4-core CPUs and 11-core GPUs? Those made way more sense. Instead, the 8700G is priced uncompetitively in part because it has twice the number of CPUcores that someone would need for a budget system.

And the 8600G is even more stupid, since it cuts 25 % of the CPU cores while cutting 33% of the GPU cores, so it has an even worse GPU-to-CPU ratio.

TL;DR: Cut the CPU cores by half, keep the GPU, use those savings to cut the price by $100, and then you'd have a product that makes sense.",code65536,45,AMD Ryzen 7 8700G,Processor,2024-01-29 14:37:24

kk5ca87,t3_1adwsqk,"The problem with the 8700G is the price and segmentation. $330 is a considerable amount, and thus you end up having to compare it to entry level CPU+GPU configurations. An i3-12100F+A750 is $300 (or RX 6600) and will blow away the 8700G in gaming, encoding, and GPU heavy workloads. You can even save money and still get better performance with a 12100F+A580 for $250. Obviously you sacrifice CPU performance in these builds, but that's a tradeoff most people would make for significantly better gaming/GPU performance.

If the full 780M iGPU was on the cheaper APUs, then it would be easier to recommend those, but at $330 for the full 780M its a hard sell, especially when you can get mobile based NUCs/Mini-PCs with similar performance that will come in smaller cases and be even more efficient.

AMD could get away with this pricing back during the crypto craze when people were looking for builds to hold them over until they could get a dGPU, that's no longer the case, so I dont think demand will be high for the 8700G.",siazdghw,29,AMD Ryzen 7 8700G,Processor,2024-01-29 14:38:04

According to these reviews, they're delivering what they promised, 1080p gaming without a dgpu.  
With power draw, CPU/iGPU performance and OCing, it seems the 8600G is a good choice for a super SSF living room PC. The 8700G is too expensive for the added performance, imo.  
I was eyeing the 8700, but now I'll probably take the 8600. 20W less in gaming than the 8700 is a good gap for a quieter and cooler system and more room to OC without upgrading the cooling.

if you want sffpc you will still get a low profile gpu, or again, a plain 7600/5700g if you arent gaming at all.

The H, HS, and Z1 Extreme are especially note worthy as they can draw proper power and really draw out those 12 CUs

###laptop side

Impressive, i can FINALLY have an ultrabook that has great gaming capabilities. Yea the cooling will suck and it'll be loud as hell but gaming was never my primary purpose. I just don't want to have to purchase a bulky laptop just for the 15-25% time that i game on it occasionally or during travels. Now i can have both. I personally have a **HP EliteBook with a 7840HS,** its great, but the cooling sucks since its an enterprise-focused device which is what i wanted, but can still sustain a 35watt draw long term and games amazing.

###Handheld side
Having all this GPU power now is great. have an **ROG Ally**, despite its flaw with the SD reader, just having something at $799 MSRP (prob discounted now, gonna guess $600?) with this kind of power and in a handheld, where i can play proper games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Read Dead Redemption 2 smoothly anywhere from 30 to 60 fps (depends on what power settings you use) on 1080p image with AI upscalers is amazing. Sure battery life for handhelds still suck but the fact that we are FINALLY here and have this CHOICE is awesome (and i also never game more than 1hour at a time helps my personal use-case)

###Mini PC side (what i'm most excited about):
Ive got a secondary location that i frequently work out of, sure i can just bring my laptop but i forget sometimes and its still not that convenient. Having a $800 Mini PC with a 7840hs will get all my office tasks done and i can still game. Better cooling than the HP ultrabook too and can draw 40 to 50 watts fairly consistently.

I could never justify buying another desktop or even bringing something bulky to this secondary work location but with a mini PC, i get vast majority of what i need in a light package that fits in my single hand and can game fairly good.

I really really wish AMD would start updating the APUs with the latest GPU architecture **every single generation** and maybe consider giving us 16 CUs or something on that end.

You can uppgrade your computer for little money with just a used 5600x (150$) and some used gpu like a 3070 or 6700xt (=350$), If you have more to spend then 5800x3d (same performance as 7600x) and better gpu but I feel like changing motherboard and ram would be a waste

Pros:
Fast. 
New platform (may make it easier to upgrade fown the line).
Cons:
7600x requires a good (probably expensive) cooler.
Currently feeling like a beta tester for the AM5 platform.
Boot times are a lot longer (especially in my motherboard unfortunately).

If you're insistent on the 7600x, definitely avoid MSI motherboards, and update the BIOS once you get your system.

ipyu057,t3_xoing5,"At least for Europe - it's honestly quite terrible value.

The price for R5 7600X in EU is 370€. So 20% more gaming performance for 85% higher price, and not even counting MOBO and RAM. R7 5800X3D users I don't think will have regrets either to be honest.

The CPU is fine, but its price makes it rather questionable value for money, imho. For US it will likely look a bit better, as there is less of an economic collapse compared to Europe.

**EDIT:** Idk why they used absurdly expensive 3600Mbps CL14 kit in cost per frame comparisons, when 3600Mbps CL16 is $100 cheaper and there will performance difference within margin of error. One would need to be not right in his mind to buy that $230 kit...

And the temperatures is absolutely nuts, 90c+ for a Ryzen 5 7600X on Cinebench is just unreal, my previous Ryzen  5 3600 doesn't even come close to 80c not even my current i5 12600K on a cheap $30 air tower cooler.

So, i can't even imagine running something like a 7600X on the same type of budget cooler, if it runs that hot on 360mm AIO, and because of that these new Zen 4 CPUs are going to require a much beefier cooling than expected so, that will also inflate the overall cost of the platform, over the Intel and previous gen AMD counterpart.

Also the AMD's very own last gen gaming top performer 5800X3D pretty much has the same performance and has better overall value if you account the motherboard, RAM, cooling cost.

I think the Ryzen 5 7600X is an impressive performer compared to last gen, but not a very good value product at all, as it feels too expensive on a very expensive platform also feels expensive to maintain due to how insanely hot it gets at least under full underload, which can be a niche case scenario if you only plan to game only.",ShadowRomeo,1,AMD Ryzen 5 7600x,Processor,2022-09-26 13:00:55

You are looking at $575 to $700 for a system that competes vs 12900k well enough.

You also save money on power because you don't need as crazy of a PSU to handle the 7600x as you would with a 12900k.... so again, you are saving money.

Also 13400F is probably a better deal price-performance vs 7600 non-X.

They are also more flexible when it comes to choice of RAM memory, and they are generally a bit more stable platform , with less common bios updates and all, also on Intel everything will work well even outside of gaming, which is not always true for AMD (you are probably not a software engineer, but a lot of tools don't work well with AMD, also a lot of random sht, in my personal experience Xiaomi Unlocker for example even has a requirement to be Intel, etc). Also those Intel CPUs have better multicore performance due to more cores, which might add to some future proofing on top of everythign else.

A budget X670 build and x570 build is less than \~$90 in price difference. That is a pretty big difference considering one can be upgrading later and one is end of life. Then it comes down to how much performance you get for that extra \~$90dollars. Which appears to be a tons for gaming, and a little less in most non-gaming workflow tasks.

&#x200B;

5900x cost for a budget build (current prices  amazon or newegg)

5900x = $360

GIGABYTE X570S AORUS Elite = $180 (cheapest viable for a 5900x out of box)

32gb DDR4 3200mhz CL16 = $90

Total = $630 + case, cooler, PSU, storage

&#x200B;

7600x cost for budget build (current prices  amazon or newegg)

7600x = $300

ASRock X670E PG Lightning = $260

G.SKILL Flare X5 series AMD EXPO 5600mhz cl36  = $160

Total = $720 + case, cooler, PSU, storage

&#x200B;

So bottom line we are looking at \~$90 more max cost. For an upgradable system, pcie 5.0, and ddr5. That likely outperforms in gaming the 5900x using equal quality coolers. Keep in mind the 5900x uses more power than the 7600x, so yea either way we are talking \~$53 starting for a cooler. Assuming an artic e34 e-sport with 2 fans.

I _did_ set the max to 165 as that's my refresh rate max, but I think lots of folks I've talked to are finding there's some kind of cap on frames regardless of the system you're running with, or perhaps the game is just poorly optimized.

That said if you live near a Micro Center they've had the 5800X for as low as $300, and I think it's currently at $329. The 5600X is sitting at $279 currently.

Only reason you'd want the extra cores is possibly if you're streaming or doing video rendering/encoding/something CPU intensive where more cores = time saved. Running virtual machines on the rig would be another reason to want more cores. Running a browser and/or Discord while gaming is not substantial multitasking and definitely will be flawless on 6C/12T.  I will say, there have been some excellent deals on the 5800X, around $350-370. If you can get it for that price, I'd say it's worth the extra money, but not if the 5600X is also on sale (my buddy got his for $270, have seen as low as $250). Again though, 5600x vs 5800x, doesn't matter in gaming, even on sale the extra cores only matter if you're doing CPU intensive  non-gaming stuff.

Your CPU usually lasts a while and most current games don't utilize 5600x close to 100%

Plus it has good single core speeds. Only real time to upgrade a CPU is for changing single core speeds in today's day and age. You should be good with a 5600x for 4-5 years at least.

I had a 2600 since launch and only replaced with 5600x for the extra core speed single. Otherwise, I really didn't need to and if I coulda got a 3070 + instead, id still have the 2600 probably.

Using 5600x and RTX 2070

Still handles *almost* all titles above 120-160 FPS on 1080p with some minor graphical adjustments. 1440p about 80-100 FPS. I do feel my GPUs age now above 1080p.

The Ryzen 5 5600X is both the entry-level and best value for money 5000 series CPU. The 5600X is a hex-core 12 thread processor with a base clock speed of 3.7 GHz boosting to 4.6 GHz. It has 35 MB of cache and a TDP rating of 65W. A cooler is included in the MSRP of $300 USD, but cheap after-market coolers (such as the $20 GAMMAXX 400) are far more effective and therefore worth the upgrade. Notably, AMD’s new Zen 3 architecture has vastly improved single-core performance and lower memory latency, which leads to a significant effective speed advantage over its predecessor, the 3600X.  
Intel’s tenth generation octa-core hyperthreaded i7-10700K is one of the fastest high-end desktop CPUs ever made. A simple overclock yields all 16 threads running at a staggering 5.1 GHz.

Personally I never saw the need to pay for an ""X"" version. You can overclock a standard one and get pretty much the same results out of both. The price is right though so I understand why they're selling so well.

The 5800x3d performs pretty closely to the 7600x at a lower price, lower power draw (saving you electricity bill money), way cheaper mobos, cheaper RAM. Even at this point in time DDR5 just doesn't seem to provide a big enough improvement over DDR4 generally so that's even more of a reason to stay with a AM4/DDR4 System. In games where there is a major difference, a lot of that can be recouped by using the money you saved by staying with an AM4 system and putting it into faster/more RAM or a better GPU... (assuming you chose a higher tier AM4 CPU to build around). I feel the additional costs of building AM5 do not reflect the performance improvement you should expect for all that extra money.

irc82v3,t3_xwxxlx,">Exactly at this point, I’ll add a speculation that might also explain why NVIDIA turned the originally planned RTX 4070 into a neutered RTX 4080 12GB. After all, there is still a lot of space between both RTX 4080s and more fits in between, so it is only a thin sheet of paper. For example, a fat Navi-31 box. NVIDIA’s spy investigative department has very rarely been wrong in the last few years, and so a green sandwich would actually be more than just schadenfreude, but almost a provocation. I don’t presume to be able to really assess AMD’s next generation, but according to all available information, it should hardly be possible to create the targeted power consumption AND increase the performance as much as NVIDIA might have managed thanks to TSMC with the older nodes.

What do people here think about this paragraph? Does it make sense?

Even if we assume that Nvidia knows that AMD's best card will have power between the two 4080 cards, why is it so much better for Nvida to sandwich that card between a 4080 12GB and a 4080 16GB, instead of sandwiching it between a 4070 and 4080?  What difference or advantage to Nvidia does this change make? Is this name change really mostly about schadenfreude and provoking AMD, and not about trying to justify the 12GB's price? 

Also even with great spying would Nvidia also know what AMD's price is going to be, and it will definitely be between the two cards? Could they really know for sure that AMD can't/won't counter the sandwich attempt by matching or beating the price of the 4080 12GB?

And if this is just speculation, why is AMD's card going between the two 4080s more likely then all the other places it could possibly fit? Why not speculate that Nvidia made this lineup so that AMD would lose to the 4080 12GB, or so that AMD would be sandwiched between the 4080 16GB and the 4090, or (maybe this is less likely but if one is more optimistic for AMD) so that AMD would be sandwiched between the 4090 and a future 4090 ti?",SomethingNew65,3,Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090,Graphics Processing Unit,2022-10-06 06:12:43
ir98x93,t3_xwxxlx,"This reads like nonsense. 

If 600W was ever going to happen, it certainly wasn't going to be on a SKU as cut down as the 4090. There's like an extra ~~30%~~ 10% or so CUDA cores left unused for the 4090, so there's room for a 4090Ti. If they were to release such a product at similar clocks to the 4090 - perhaps in the future alongside higher clocked GDDR6X - well then there might be a need for 600W.

But that's only really if AMD can compete with such a part or if they want to maximise the difference between the 4090 and 4090Ti to try and justify higher potential prices. The second one isn't a given at the end end of the day - they didn't exactly provide a compelling price reason to buy the 3090Ti over the 3090.",uzzi38,19,Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090,Graphics Processing Unit,2022-10-06 06:12:43

That's already kinda the case, and has been for a lil bit for obvious reasons, but what if, coupled with the supply chain issues and all, the costs of R&D nowadays and expectations on hardware keeping up with software, a case was made that it made just as much if not more sense to make their own hardware for themselves, keep it, and just let people pay to use it.  What if the only ways we could continue making computers faster just increased the prices of specialized high end hardware more and more and more, with ever increasing complexity?

Graphics cards are becoming not too dissimilar to sports cars, its not just the upfront cost of the card its being able to afford the petrol and how much the total cost is going to be over the life of graphics card.

Could not guarantee I would be able to get one the new xtx cards and that left me with the shitty price of the 4080. I'm not happy I had to pay double what I paid for my 1080ti but I don't really give a shit about anyone else and I could afford it.

Its not a great card for overclocking due to power design, but thats my point. The cards that are hundreds more with crazy power phase design are not pushing much higher clocks and overall the difference in performance is negligible anyways. Some of it is silicon lottery too.

The 12700k is like 0-2% slower in gaming than a 12900k, even at 1080p, the i7 and i9 should definitely be on the same tier. I'd pair the 12600k with the 5000 series for the lower tier.

In my country it costs closer to $2k with customs fees and tax on top of MSRP, but if that card lasts me 5 years, I would honestly not be a bad deal.

irwqa9z,t3_y17jrj,"It's interesting that we see charts like [this](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/39.html) on TPU, where the 4090 is only drawing 350w in their ""gaming"" scenario, or how it had an average 284w power consumption on F1 2022. This is a pretty clear sign that the card is running up against other bottlenecks on a number of different games.

I kind of wonder how best to even benchmark such a ridiculously powerful card- many games are running well over 100, 200 FPS at 4k, and appear not to fully utilize the GPU. At a point it all becomes academic, because monitors tend to max out around 4k 120hz/144hz, but the end result is that simply saying ""the average FPS improvement is 45%"" doesn't actual capture how big of a performance improvement the card provides in games that can actually make use of all that extra power. 

DF used an interesting metric, which was ""joules per frame""- this helps to capture how much the card is actually stressed. The card gets a 62% boost in frame rate vs. the 3090 in F1 22, but actually uses less power on average- only 284w compared to the 3090s 331w, so clearly not being pushed anywhere near its limit.

I have to wonder if it'd be worth testing things like 8k gaming, just to   really test its rasterization performance. Even though the information wouldn't be too useful (since very few people even own 8k TVs), it could be interesting to show us hypothetical performance improvements in games without RT, but with more intensive rasterization performance requirements (future UE5 games, maybe?).

The negatives are that most of what upcharge you paid for (LCD screen, RGB, software) .... don't work? That's absolutely ridiculous, even if you don't care about those features. Not to mention gigabyte customer support is notoriously awful. 

Coil whine is ultimately RNG. My Aorus Master had a little bit, not really audible unless you put your ear to the case but it's there.

Decent cooler contact, but not perfect

High transient power spikes

Reading the other replies and I feel like I'm missing something. At 1440p/RT/Ultra on the worst title benchmarked (CyberPunk) it ran close to 80fps. And neither 4080 nor 7900xtx can hit the 120fps with these settings so consistent/high 60fps+ seems like the best you can do at the price tier. As a 1440p gamer, that looks good to me. Not to mention it'll trade blows with 4080 on raster going forward. 

Others are saying it's not worth $1000 tag, but at that price what is a better value? Why would I spend extra $200 just for an nvidia brand at this point?

izyy1kb,t3_zjzws8,"it's what i expected it to be . as a shareholder i bought amd for their server cpu's and embedded socs. not their gpu's. so i don't really care the card is mediocre. it's good enough to sell for some people that really cannot aford a 4080 or 4090. but then again why should they spend 1000$ on a gpu if they can't pay 20% more....  
  
trading blows with 4080 but if you pay 20% more you get ray tracing and dlss and shit all over the 7900xtx.  
  
easy choice for buyers imo. if you already pay thousand dollars you don't want to play on low medium settings. which is what playing without RT essentialy is. it's like playing a game in early 2000's with shadows of or early 2010's with tesselation off.  
  
i'm not buying it and staying with my 3080. it's a sidegrade at best since the only thing worth upgrading for is RT performance. rastered games run on a toaster/ console that have 2060 performance. i already cap out most games at 144-240 fps on my 1440p/244hz monitor in non RT games.  
  
also doesn't help that FRS is a joke compared to dlss. would have thought they would atleast have released the card with a hardware scaler now that the amd cards have dedicated AI cores.  
  
can't wait for all the rabid fanboys that are gonna downvote me for daring to say the truth out loud. i wanted this to be a good card as anyone else as a shareholder but you gotta face the truth people. time for the hopium/copium to wear off.  
  
the target market for this card barely exists. people that buy such high end cards also want the full package ( RT, DLSS and raster performance) and not a card that is good at one thing and bad at the other 2.  
  
noone would buy an iphone if it had a shit camera or shit OS but has the fastest soc in the world. people buy iphones because they are the best in everything or within margin of error the best in nearly everything. not good in 1 facet and mediocre to dogshit in others.

izxk546,t3_zjzris,"*Decent* is really all that can say in regards to it being a value option for $1000. We indeed did not see a ~50% uplift over the 6950 XT (more like 35-40% depending on the game in question), but I will say it's possibly a driver issue along with potential kinks with the chiplet design, being a first gen product for AMD. Though for +$1000 and up you really should expect those kinds of things to be working as intended out the box.

While the 4080 is overpriced, you're getting more from it as far as the feature set and RT if you care about that. Personally both the 7900 XTX and 4080 need a price cut. $800 and $900 sounds pretty reasonable imo. Otherwise I'm staying on my 3080 and skipping this gen.

izx7y8p,t3_zjzris,"Well this has been deflating. I guess I was expecting more, but it really is just trading blows with the 4080. Other thoughts:

- They really marketed the small size, but from what I gather, the FE is about at the limit on thermals even on open test benches. In a medium to small form factor case, you’ll have no OC room or might even need to undervolt.

- Makes sense why AIBs are showing enormous coolers due to the above. Really need to see AIB benchmarks (and prices) now.

- Power draw seems to be fudged a bit. Yes the averages are as advertised, but the spikes in a few reviews are nearly double the average. You might need a 1000W power supply depending on the rest of your system. But maybe this can be fixed with driver updates.

- AMD is chalked if Nvidia drops the price on the 4080 by even $100

7900 xtx needs to be about $800 to grab market share. 4080 really should be about $900. This is still super expensive, but market I think the above make sense. 

7900 xtx its about the same as a rtx 4080 (win some lose some but essentially to me the RTX 4080 wins overall even in rasterization). 

Its also better for production / work, and more efficient (by a small amount but its there). 

So essentially the 4080 is better at every comparison point, other than being huge (no reason for this other than laziness of NVIDIA and AIB's using the 4090 cooler)

Ray tra 3080 ti really beats or is on par at ray tracing with the 7900 xtx. This is really the most disappointing part.

even at the $1000 vs $1200 price points, the extra $200 for some people is worth the Ray Tracing and just overall better support / codecs / etc.

izygtdk,t3_zjzris,"Overall, I think 7900XTX is decent product. Yes times have changed and $1000 isn't exactly cheap, but let's not forget this is top of the range flagship, this isn't mid-range like 5700XT or 290/390/480/580/590 generation and if we compare to true flagships of last 10 years the price isn't as horrendous as it may seem.

Inflation warps our perspective e.g. top range Fury X in 2015 costed $649, that with inflation is equivalent to \~$838 today. In 2011 6990 costed $699 - that is $944 today. Going even further back - 4870x2 was $549 in 2008, that is $847 today. And you can say - yeah but they were 2 GPUs... yes that was the name of the game back then, they were still comparable to what 7900XTX represents today.

I am not defending inflated prices, but they are not ""DOUBLE"", they are \~$100 more than we would have paid like for like 10 years ago. Where it kind of hurts is that before MSRP used to be the ""TOP"" price you pay for first 3 months and then the cards would be discounted. Whereas now all the cards are above MSRP and even 6 months later they are still above MSRP.

But that is simple supply and demand. There are signs that market is cooling a lot, there are rumours that 4080 is not selling, it was scalped, but now scalpers can't even sell it for MSRP, there is chance that in January we will see cards selling under MSRP like in good old days.

Other thing to note - we got used to play at ridiculous FPS. In older days 60FPS was the target, 5 years ago outside of absolute most basic competitive titles like CS:GO 100FPS was the limit. Now we have ""last gen"" GPUs pushing in excess of 200FPS and still contemplating upgrading! So I guess if we had little bit more realistic expectations spending $1000 on new GPU would not be necessary and in 3 months we would be able to pick them-up for $600-700 mark.

In the end we vote with our wallet and that is what we have. 7900XTX was overhyped a little bit, but it still provides best cost per frame in current gen. Even better cost per frame than discounted 6800XT and 6900XT... and much better than 4080 and 4090. So it is good value product, it is competitive it mostly matches or beats 4080 for $299 less. I am not ""amazed"" by it, but I can't say I am disappointed either.

If there would be 1 ask then I would like to see reference design like in Fury X or at least like on my current 6900XT LC. Cards with 300W+ TDP really need to come water cooled from factory, because these air behemoths are just stupid. And to be fair AMD did decent job, Nvidia 4080/4090 are just idiotic, but it could be better as well illustrated by Fury X, which was compact, cool and quiet (sadly it wasn't very competitive otherwise). I would even be happy if they offer ""naked"" card at say $100 discount, so that I can get GPU block myself. Apart of that I am quite happy with overall placement of the product and performance.",afgan1984,0,AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX,Graphics Processing Unit,2022-12-12 13:55:34

with the average performance jump being 35% with many games below even that. They've definitely pumped their numbers before with every single GPU launch press but this is by far the worst one yet. it led to people having way too high expectations for this GPU, I guessed the average would be below 50% because of the small amount of games tested and cherry-picking and lack of 4090 comparisons but dang

We all know 4080 isn't priced right. 

3080 was 700 iirc, 4080 should have been at 800 (+100 gen on gen let's say). It's at 1200. 

A 1000$ card is simply trading in raster and is beaten in RT with a card that is absolutely not in the right category. If the 4080 wasn't 1200, then what would you say. ""Still 200$ less""? This card would be 700 to 800 as well. 

Nvidia's pricing has allowed a 700-800$ worth AMD to be at 1K. AMD isn't disrupting, they are just delivering on the bare minimum promise. 

Yes 4080 is 1200, but that doesn't excuse AMD to be 1000 as well. GPU's are overpriced. 7900XT is priced similarly to how 4080 is to 4090. Just to show the higher level card is the value product.

NVIDIA could take the 5080 to 1500$ and AMD 8900XTX would be value at 1200/1300$. The GPU market is fully in the hands of NVIDIA pricing stuff.",Sumit_S,28,AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX,Graphics Processing Unit,2022-12-12 14:37:55

How is this a nitpick?

>but card sag caused by the lack of triangulation makes it only a passing grade, definitely not a good one.

Yeah, because it came with a bracket, they provided a solution. If you dont use it, then that is a user error, and it will sag if you dont support it somehow. Why trangulate it if you have a solution to it? Watching a little too much Jay?

Again, this shouldn't even be a complaint because they provided a bracket. Should be glad they did. Some dont.

Was also getting some regular crashes with the card but didn’t have it for long enough to work out what the issue was. Noted, I also had some HDR issues with the Samsung g8 (the AMD card would only support HDR400). Overall performance was very good and I thought the image sharpening was a great feature (not sure if nvidia have anything like this?).

\- When i've decided to upgrade my rig (had a 6800xt and 5600x cpu) i was torn between a 4080 and a 7900xtx...

Where i live everything is expensive (brazil), so, a RTX 4080 XLR8 and 7900xtx were almost on the same price (7900xtx was 100$ more than 4080)...

i've decided to go with the 4080, mainly because of the following reasons:

&#x200B;

* DLSS and sometimes ray tracing (mainly DLSS, RT is right at the bottom of my priorities)
* Better drivers (i've had my 6800xt since day one, and since day one, AMD drivers were a pain in the butt, for example, i couldn't play Destiny 2, a game i've played daily and had over 2k hours on steam alone, when the beyond light DLC dropped cuz there was a incompatibility with the shader cache used by Bungie and my fps wouldn't go past 40fps, that last for over a YEAR!)
* Overall better performance in the games i play.

I understand that 7900xtx is better gpu than my 4080...but, unfortunately, driver wise, was abysmal and i'm not going back...

The RX 7900-XTX has a bit better pure raster performance, but lacks the ability for NVidia's by now rather excellent DLSS, which can transform 1440p gaming, into 4K gaming, with very little and/or next to nothing in the way of graphical irregularities which give the game away that the game is being upscaled. In some cases, DLSS (quality) even looks better than Native due to it's superior anti-aliasing method. The AMD upscaler equivalent by comparison, is fucking terrible. You wouldn't want to use it, if you could avoid doing so.

Also, the  RX 7900-XTX uses far more power, and runs much hotter, than the 4070ti, and consequently the fans run a lot louder.

- RX 7900 xtx is on par with 4080 and in some cases, better.

- If you care about ray tracing, dlss and frame generation then go Nvidia.

- RX 7900 xtx is the best for price per performance, meaning it's the better value for what you get.

- If you're spending 1k+ on a GPU, I would go for something that's reliable in terms of software and that would be Nvidia. AMD are known for their shit drivers. (But it's better nowadays, I've used 6700 XT and it was the best 1440p gpu I've had)

- For future proofing, RX 7900 xtx 24gb ram can last you long for the years to come.

- AMD GPU are power hungry and an RX 7900 xtx needs at least 850w PSU while a 4080 requires around 750W or less.

- If you want a hassle free experience with little to no troubleshooting or drivers problem then Nvidia.

- If you're doing content creation, Nvidia.

Do you tend to play a mix of both? Then it gets muddy but I'd lean towards the 7900XTX and bet on FSR3 helping AMD cards bridge the software gap with Nvidia.  For pure rasterization performance the 7900XTX is superior and more VRAM is a really good thing to have for the future.

I personally lean towards Nvidia because right NOW, DLSS is vastly superior to FSR and AMD until FSR3 has no equal for frame generation so the Nvidia cards spank AMD when it comes to RTX performance.

jj7i3z8,t3_10dndcs,"I have looked at this thread for some time, and I am sad that this is still kinda true.

I bought mine for size limitation reasons: I put it in an NZXT H1 (v2)

Would I recommend you do the same: No-ish. Without additional fans, my RAM temps on idle consistently climb up - up to even 80-90 degrees. I think due to two reasons: 1. The card sadly does not seem to spin up fans based on RAM temps (many don't), so unless you get them to spin up, you accumulate temps (slowly). 2. The case without additional fans has no passive airflow over the cooler.

My solution was to add a fan to the back outside ... which is OK. It drops temps down to stable 64 and does not add much noise. Also doesn't look too bad tbh ...

So, I would not recommend a NZXT H1 (v2) build with the card. It's sub-optimal for cooling. Interestingly, the raiser card in front (glass) also gets very hot and sadly has absolutely no cooling :\*( But I can tell you that it will likely work out watt wise with 6000MT/s and a 7700x ;) Never had a crash. It's not a strong no, not an impossibly bad build, but you are living on the edge a bit with the temps.

What would I do if I could redo this:

\- Maybe get a Fractal Ridge or Meshlicious ... ?

\- Probably just get a bigger case and a nitro+ :\*(

I still like the build - but I have my concerns. I probably get a front plate with airflow (another 100+ bucks) and maybe put a fan there ... :\*(

No Cyberpunk? Like, the single game that is incredibly well optimized AND absolutely bends GPUS at max settings both in rasterization and in raytracing, giving a fair and square playing field? The tests on F1, GTA5 and R6 Siege feel like all testing the same thing: low impact games that scale well. We don't need 3 of them. They add latency testing because ""framerate has become comically high"" - yeah if you keep testing low detail games maybe that's why, making a solution for their own problem: just remove those benchmarks and test only on the most relevant one, which may be Counter Strike 2, and do your latency testing there, instead of being surprised a game released in late 2015 (that's 8+ years ago) has ""too high fps to matter""?  


RT tests on F1 22 and Dying Light? Like what the f. is the point.  


HWU has got a much more solid benchmark suite, at least, but someone has to tell GN to stop this. When I heard they were ""refreshing"" their benchmarks suite I was ""finally"" then the result is that they added more testing to validate their testing on 8 years old games across the field.

It was always my understanding that max settings were designed for hardware not currently on the market on release, or at least since Crysis originally released, hence why the recent Avatar game had to 'hide' its max settings so people wouldn't be disappointed when the game didn't run well at the them.

koqbt02,t3_1ahowiy,I kinda agree with the OP. The 4070 Super is probably the best card of the refresh. I think the VRAM issue was overblown. Not saying we shouldn’t have more because we definitely should have been given more VRAM at that price. But some people have hard limits on what they are willing to spend on a video card. And the experience that the 4070 super offers is great. Most people are not as OCD about their FPS and visual eye candy so they don’t care about being over 60 FPS or having ray traced shadows. They just want to enjoy the game. I also agree with the sentiments that you can’t compare the 8GB VRAM era with the current landscape that the 4070S finds itself in. The 3070 did come out at a time where games were mostly being made for the PS4/XboxOne then ported to the PS5/ Xbox Series X. Which the PS4/XboxOne were being held back mostly by its computer power. I believe they were based on AMDs Jaguar APUs which were intended for low powered laptop and tablets. 12GBs of VRAM should be fine in most games for at least a couple of years. And I think the launch of the 4070 Ti Super proved it. With a lot of people being let down by its performance despite its magical 16GBs of VRAM. I think PC gamers spend more time looking at their performance overlays than enjoying the games and we need to get use to not always having to play every game at Ultra. Especially when you can’t really tell a difference between Ultra and High/Medium.

Well, bold statement. I've just going to throw a scenario to you:

If someone has a 1440p 240hz> monitor and wants to fully take advantage of it, definitely not overkill. Depends on the FPS requirements you find acceptable. Several games at 1440p don't reach 240 (trust me, I know).

But anyway, it's an extremely solid GPU, love the price/performance and will definitely recommend it to a lot of friends that want to upgrade. And just to be clear, I believe that anything above a 4070S/TiS isn't a smart buy under 4K.

No lol. I actually do know about technology and am professionally involved to be paid to write on it and consult on it at times. It doesn't matter how long you've been using GPUs. That's irrelevant. It doesn't give you any particular understanding beyond that of the average user, which isn't good to be honest. There is no argument to authority here that's credible, based on 'well I've used them so therefore I'm some sort of expert now.' I'm glad that you have a good experience with your GPU. That does matter a great deal, but the arguments presented here are either just factually incorrect, or without appropriate context. This isn't a matter of opinion, but of easily checkable fact.

So no again. I'd far rather go with facts, than some unfounded opinion that goes against facts, or just ignores them completely.  Oh and please do look up what CPU limited means, as using heavily CPU limited games as examples in this thread for GPU performance...it's not helping with credibility, let's put it that way.

And please don't try and argue with facts. It's just tedious and annoying. Treat it as a learning experience and save everyone's time. But absolutely yes, please do learn more and enjoy learning more. At the very least you'll be both better informed in future, won't be embarrassing yourself and will save a lot of money too.

It would be one thing if you're only comparing Nvidia hardware, but you're including the 6800xt/7800xt, 7900xt and 7900xtx too and it gives off favorable results when you only review games that favor that hardware. This is where that AMD bias creeps in, like AMD Unboxed's repeated use of a 9 year old indie game in every review because AMD hardware kills on it and it skews the overall results in their favor. Either pick the top 10 games being played by volume of players or pick 5 games that run well on AMD and 5 games that run well on Nvidia. If you're going to claim to be fair and impartial, actually be fair and impartial.

I like Gamers Nexus and the general direction they're moving (aside from the satire that's been becoming more and more common), but this is the one area that is wide open for bias, depending on which games you use for your data sets.

jzetsg4,t3_16bjryx,"I think most people are missing the point with this card.

The 6800XT was launched at $650. After a while it was lowered to $600, after the early adopters tax is paid off. That's how it always is. The 7900XT and XTX were also lowered by about $100 after a couple months

So to be fair you need to compare launch price vs launch price, and this is priced even lower than what the RX6800 was launched at ($579). So the $500 launch price will most definitely turn into $450 or less in a couple months.

$450 is also where you find the 4060Ti 16GB, after they lowered it from it's launch price from $500 last week. Compared to the 4060Ti 16GB, the 7800XT offers 42% better performance.

The point of this card is not so much the slight performance lift from previous gens 6800XT, it's the lower price and to some extent, better efficiency and FSR 3 features. Plus the RDNA 3 features like AV1 De-and encode, Displayport 2.1 (which not even the 4090 has), and future driver improvements that AMD usually take their sweet time with :)

k6pym00,t3_16bjryx,"If we leave aside the segmentation or naming of the RX7800XT, this card is just above the RTX4070.  DLSS or FSR, whatever they mean, is this: ""guys, we made a card, but our cards cannot handle ray tracing, so we are giving you this software. You will get higher FPS with this software.""

This is exactly what DLSS or FSR means.  Frankly, when Nvidia or AMD will produce GPUs that comfortably deliver high FPS without DLSS or FSR, then all these cards will be truly mature.  I've used Nvidia for the last 5 generations. GTX and RTX various cards.  2060, 2070, 2080 super, 3060ti and 3070ti.  It's all up to you. I haven't used either DLSS or Ray Tracing much.  The ridiculous thing is that some games give high fps on Nvidia, some on AMD, with ray tracing turned on.  These card companies make agreements with the game producers they attract and ensure that those games get high fps on their cards.  In other words, it all depends on the game companies making the optimizations properly.  AMD is a little more passive in this regard.  I believe that when they fix this on the software side, they will not lag behind nvidia.  They should be aggressive like in ATI's time.

Finally, I switched from the RTX3070TI to the 7800XT and I have no issues to complain about.  It offers RT performance between RTX 3070 and 3080.  It is ahead of 4070 in thoroughbred performance.

I'm the kind of person who cares about quietness. And I got it. Maxed out, it reaches around 280W (I haven't bothered with undervolting) and despite that it's quiet. I have two 140mm fans on low RPM that are quietly blowing air in, and that's enough to keep it sufficiently cool.

It also has no coil wine. Quality components. I'm extremely happy.

I've been using it on a 4K 144Hz monitor. 
With light games I target 4K@144Hz high/max settings.  
With heavy games I target 4K@90Hz med/high, while using FSR, all smooth with FreeSync.

This is all I need. Exceeding 60Hz on a 4K display... Often with high or max settings... With a quiet PC...

P.S. With 16GB of RAM I know I won't be forced to update for a long time. Probably in a few years I'll make heavier use of FSR and drop the settings to medium, while keeping the 4K resolution and making around 60fps.

Upgraded from a 2070 super and I have no regrets. I have not done any Ray tracing because I still think it's a waste of performance for how good it looks granted it looks amazing but when you're playing a game all I really care about is how smooth it is. Being able to just click ultra and set the 4K resolution it's amazing.

jzfuql0,t3_16bjufu,"I think most people are missing the point with this card.

The 6800XT was launched at $650. After a while it was lowered to $600, after the early adopters tax is paid off. That's how it always is. The 7900XT and XTX were also lowered by about $100 after a couple months

So to be fair you need to compare launch price vs launch price, and this is priced even lower than what the RX6800 was launched at ($579). So the $500 launch price will most definitely turn into $450 or less in a couple months.

$450 is also where you find the 4060Ti 16GB, after they lowered it from it's launch price from $500 last week. Compared to the 4060Ti 16GB, the 7800XT offers 42% better performance.

The point of this card is not so much the slight performance lift from previous gens 6800XT, it's the lower price and to some extent, better efficiency and FSR 3 features. Plus the RDNA 3 features like AV1 De-and encode, Displayport 2.1 (which not even the 4090 has), and future driver improvements that AMD usually take their sweet time with :)

A 7800 XT the cheapest I can find as of writing is $879 AUD, that's converted to USD with tax included ~$561 USD which is about right once you add 10% GST/VAT and maybe some extra fees for being shipped to a penal colony. 

The cheapest 4070 is like $889 AUD. So yeah the 4GB of VRAM extra is nice, but the RT performance, DLSS and other features like NVIDIA Broadcast and just general driver stability or rendering performance keep the RTX 4070 lingering around as an option. The $100 pricing gap between the 7800 XT and the 4070 in the USA is basically not really a thing here.

The 7800 XT desperately needs a price drop here in Australia to be a relevant purchase. A good $80 AUD price drop puts the 7800 XT into a spot of consideration. But then I remember that a used 6800 XT goes for around $650 AUD, so unless you really use RT or want AV1 can't see a reason to buy a 7800 XT.

The main complaint is that the card is named a 7800xt leading the consumer to believe that it is the next generation successor of the 6800xt, when in fact the performance is the roughly the same. I get how on the surface this complaint seems valid, but what devalues that complaint is this. The rx6800xt launched on Nov 18 of 2020 with an msrp of $649. That is 3 years ago and $150 more than the msrp of the 7800xt. 3 years of unheard inflation and yet AMD gives us a card of the same caliber for $150 less. I’m not trying to fan boy them, I’m just saying from their perspective it seems like a good deal. 

I understand that now the rx6800xt can be had for $500 or less, but also that’s not AMD dropping the msrp. That’s due to retailers adjusting to the market. The same thing will happen to the rx7800xt as well given time. 

Is the naming changeup confusing and ultimately kind of dumb? Sure it is, makes no sense from a consumer standpoint. However, given all of the details I think that this card is priced at a fair spot and does provide great value compared to the competition in 2023.

The problem is if you care about those things then you buy NVidia not AMD this generation. If you don't care about those features (plus NVidia focused stuff) enough to spend $100 more then maybe?

Don't get me wrong I think most people will be better served saving that $100, but then again, I think most people would be best served buying a used 3080 for $100 less than the 7800XT.

So if you're okay buying used, get a 3080 for about $100 less than the 7800XT. If you aren't but also care specifically about 40 series features then you cough up $600.

7800XT should have had 72CUs to give a potential double-digit gain over 6800XT (72CU vs 72CU).  
7700XT could have stayed 54CU part (60CU as 7750XT refresh).

Price wise, release MSRP is closer to that of the 6700XT, and cheaper than the 6750XT.  

Outside brand names, it is also a Navi 32, where the 6700XT is a Navi 22.  

7800XT with 60CUs is on par with a 6800XT 72CU. 

60CU (7800XT) vs 60CU (6800), the 7800XT seems to be 15% faster in raster and 20% faster in RT than the 6800.  Wonder how much of that would be down to increased clock speeds vs IPC.  And how much impact the halving of L3 cache would halve. 

Would have been nice if like the 7800XT was the 7700XT, the 7700XT the 7700, then an actual release of the 7900GRE as the 7800XT and another cutdown Navi 31 as the 7800.  I wonder how much more people would have been satisified if the card was called the 7700XT rather than the 7800XT, lol. 

But I also wonder if they are kinda shifting their product stack for RDNA4, if they aren't going to have a halo product.  60CUs or there abouts might be the biggest die we get.

* 7800 XT performance is equivalent to 6800 XT.  With the generation improvement, 7800 XT is basically tiered to 6800 level.  
* In other words, 7800 XT is effectively 7800.  But Marketing wants to have the XT in the name.
* (On nVidia side, this is similar to the 4080 12GB, which was nothing close to 4080 and is now 4070 Ti).

In terms of pricing, AMD is an OK value if we compare to today's inflated nVidia pricing. In big picture, compared to pre-COVID pricing, this is quite sad.  And today's demand is no longer crazy like during COVID and crypto-currency crunch.

The reported inflation between end of 2020 and now is a little over 22%.

So this thing is beating rx 6800 at an MSRP 30% lower at launch than what it was 3 years ago and people still cry as little babies.

If i was in the market for a new card right now, i would be getting a 7800xt.

--------

If anyone from AMD is reading this...

AMD....you could have made this gcd die just 20% larger with the same 4 mcd and memory, that would not have increased the BOM that much. Kept this price and cu count for a 7800, and given us a true 7800xt with 20-25% higher cu count for $600 instead. Margin should have even been slightly higher with that die size and cost increase.

Or course that would put it closer or even too close to the navi31 based cards....but then navi31 could have easily been 25% larger as well....

I know this was designed back during the crypto boom, and you wanted to save die space.... But, you cut it too much...please do better next gen.

Nvidia certainly doesn't get a pass on this either. They also used small die, and of course they also used too little vram on top of that, so its even worse for them.",idwtlotplanetanymore,2,AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT,Graphics Processing Unit,2023-09-06 13:01:51

The advantage of the 7800XT over the 6800XT is that it delivers only a modest performance increase (3%), but it does so at a lower launch price (the 6800XT launched at $650) and offers better efficiency.

Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I realized that the way they OC their cards is different than how some other reviewers have shown. For eg, maxing out the max clock speed to “5000” while setting the minimum clock to 2800. I think when I first tried to follow this when the 7800xt first came out, my system kept crashing, no matter what voltage I put the card in. After following some other guides, the OC/UV settings are done very differently, and I see that some people have followed this guide also have experienced crashes and instability trying to folllow this guide. I know techpowerup isn’t some random YT guide, but so far (anecdotally), this method doesn’t seem to work very well, anyone have insight to their methodology, vs say starting from the default setting and lowering the power limit and voltage, then slowly change the max clock speeds while checking for instability?",ieatfrosties,4,AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT,Graphics Processing Unit,2023-09-26 05:26:15

I think AMD have gotten the basics right again and the cards usually work fine, and it's a compelling product for $100 less than the 4070.

Only issue is that I kind of actually agree here with essentially the same performance as a 4070, and I'm in one of those places where the 7800xt is the same price as a 4070, and there are parts of the world where Radeon is sometimes more expensive, so where the pricing is the same, this card is pretty hard to justify since the 4070 will be the better pick in most situations.

My only guess is that the person that runs that site may be based in Asia where Radeon can be overpriced, and has probably been burned by issues that were around the Polaris era where AMD did have the performance crown, but bugs and inconsistency, or may have had an overheating issue.

I been looking at 4060ti for a month plus but didn't buy yet because this. Most cards don't have reviews and u must buy blinded. Just example - inno3d ichill 4060ti is non existent, you have no idea about temps, weight or even simple unboxing. On top on that in their official site you get not real photos but 3d model.

Anyway with release of rx7700/7800 everything changed. The thing that stops me now is power consumption. Is it possible to make it under 240w for example? Also do you need support bracket for these, they all look heavy (3 fan models)? Also good you shared most heavy test, how different is from gaming?

In very heavy games/new AAA games, you should get 60-80 fps with high/ultra quality settings at 1440p, but reducing a thing or two, without losing image quality should get you in the 80-100 fps range in games like Hogwarts, Cyberpunk, The Last of Us etc.

In anything else, you will get high framerates, more than enough for a 1440p 144Hz display.

RX 6700 XT in 2023 is good deal imo ,yes is an 2y old card but it aged well , even the non-xt version is good deal(depending on your region ) , I thought about getting an 3060ti instead but the Vram bothers me lol , i'm saying this but my rx 570 is even the 4gb version lol anyway , for 1440p the RX 6700XT is ""perfect"" .   
  
After watching many videos about it i am almost certain i will get one soon , just checking deals because i want the sapphire version on sale , i live in europe here is not quite the same as US market , i found an sapphire model for 365€ but it changed back to MSRP on the next day so i am waiting for another deal haha  
  
One thing I've learned after researching is upgrading only GPU is not as used to be , yes you will get the major improve for it but CPU / Ram influences a lot this days.   
Yes if you don't care you can just put an GPU on my build for example , like an 6700XT or an 3060 TI and i believe it will be bottlenecked, but in  the end of day upgrading from an rx570 or in your case 1050ti it will be a massive improve , like double or triple performance? idk but around that.  
  
Now i don't know the rest of your build but i assume is the same ""tier"" as 1050ti , if not and you have an good CPU and rest of your system on pair, you good to go , just my2cents as i am in the same boat as you kind of , planning to upgrade this week or so.

You can look at some benchmarks, but in 2023, the best is a 4090. So, if you compare it to EVERYTHING available at the moment, no it’s not good. Keep in mind, in newer games, especially unoptimized ones, it can use upwards of 10GB VRAM at 1080p. I couldn’t believe it at first when I looked at my monitoring when playing uncharted.

All seriousness though, it’ll run everything at 1440p, but it depends on the settings you pick. Depends a lot on your budget, but prolly the best deal for a card around that price. I know it can run most games at max settings 1440p above 60fps, but there’s probably some stuff out there it can’t. From a 1050ti, it’s a huge upgrade. Just make sure you need it.

k1tyo5y,t3_14e0vlc,"I might be late but I have it and will run anything at 1080p  60fps on ultra.

I have a 75hz monitor capped at 60hz as I don't see a high noticeable difference (if monitor is at 75hz and cap the game at 60fps those will look worse, I think because the monitor refresh rate). 

I know the 6700xt is vastly capable to push to 75fps but currently playing TLOU: Part I and just had enough with frame drops from 75 to 55 in some zones. This made me think that newer games or bad optimizated games will have this kind of issues too (I believe starfield can't reach 70fps 1080p Ultra with 6700xt in some zones).

So tired of having to worry about this stuff just capped to 1080p 60hz and I'm fine with it, that way I'll be used to 60fps (I actually came from PS4 so it's fine) by future games.

Also, I may be paranoid but games capped at 60fps by default (for example Blasphemous) look a bit better with monitor at 60hz.

30xx did dual issue SP.

AMD did the Infinity cache first.

40xx is same big cache and same high clocks.

Where to go next? 3nm and even 2nm wont let you raise clocks. Transistor density improves a little. Vast majority of savings is lower power.

So like CPU that hit Mhz wall, you increase cores. But that doesnt work. Big chip = big chance of defects.

So like AMD, multi chip. Problem is bigger cost. Validation. Durability.

* 3080 8704 30 TFLOPS  85%

* 3070 5888 20 TFLOPS  57%

* 3060ti 4864 16 TFLOPS 46%

* 3060 3584 13 TFLOPS  37%

pretty closely spaced


Now look at how 40 series scales:

* 4090 16384 82 TFLOPS

* 4080 9728 48 TFLOPS 58%

* 4070 5888 29 TFLOPS 35%

* 4060ti 4352 22 FLOPS 27%

* 4060 3072 16 TFLOPS 19%

huge chasms - really stretching out the lineup


How it should have been. Using 30 series scaling on 40 series:
4090 - SAME

* 85% 4080 70TFLOPS = 14,000 SP   <-- the missing link

* 57% 4070 47TFLOPS = about same as current 4080

* 46% 4060ti 38TFLOPS = bit slower than current 4070ti

jlg9944,t3_13po3md,"4060 ti giving same performance at half power consumption of 3060ti & 3070 ti. 3070ti beats it by almost double power consumption. 4060ti is a good buy in today's economy, i don't see their competitors even trying. 6700XT is inferior to this in every way. vram issue is non-existent after few patches, HUB wont make videos on it tho.

talk about temperature. 4060ti temperature ranges from 53c to 61c. 6700xt goes beyond 75c with double power consumption and inferior performance.

4060ti performs above 3070 and below 3070ti in gaming.

launch pricing is always absurd for every company. see AMD 6 core cpu launch at $300. absurdity. its very common thing. if they have old inventory for 3060TI then its logical to launch new product at higher price so people will suck up old inventory fast and they went big with 3000 production due to crypto boom. now i think they are in difficult situation on how to price their cards, even AMD launched their flagship at $1k. 3000 series was a massive success for NVIDIA. it was soo good that people are expecting same performance uplift next gen that is simply impossible in tech.

finally DLSS3. its freaking massive for 1080p. take example of witcher 3 ultra 1080p - native it gives 40 FPS, with DLSS3+frame gen it gives 91 FPS. thats massive performance uplift.  its truly an awesome feature.

for blender and similar production workstation use, its faster than 3070ti.

talking about ray tracing on 1080p its best in its price class, It surpasses ray tracing performance of 6900XT at $400. thats nuts. there is no competition when it comes RT and feature set.

Its open budget market for all, intel gpus cant match it at $400, AMD gpus cant match it at $400.  i doubt they are going to drop price for this one. considering 3060TI is still selling well around its launch price. once 3060ti inventory dries up they might discount it maybe $50.

&#x200B;

They made massive improvement in feature-set and efficiency. about price its up to people if $400 is digestible to them or not . AMD and intel are welcome to provide better card at lower price but i don't think they will. at max they will do is around $50 undercutting for similar performance and less feature-set(like no cuda lol). its up-to people if that $50 is enough incentive to switch.

$400 for 1080p gaming - doesn't sound good but there is no competition in this price class thus price is set at higher band.  I hope AMD launches new card so there is some incentive to drop price without it who would choose to make less money when you can make more. it makes no sense to leave money on table when demand is there. Any of these tech tubers will gladly charge absurd money for their expertise if someone is willing to pay, this is how open market works. i am not happy about pricing but some improvement is there. There are lof of people spreading misinformation that this card is same as 3060ti, this is not true.

&#x200B;

There seems to be lot of misinformation going on thread about its performance. Some people are even claiming it be performing less than 6700xt, that is simply not true.

jlami74,t3_13po3md,"I know i'll get alot of shit for saying this but Im Sorry, im honestly sick of these reviews. I get that all these reviewers want 100% PTP increases and 2010 pricing back but at some point you have to be ok with just buying something. 

3000 series cards are becoming scarce and dont provide that big of a price discount anyway.

This is the market now. $400 for a card that gets you all the cutting edge architecture and features and gets 100+ frames at 1440p maxed out on almost anything is not bad.

I think it just disingenuous and out of touch for reviewers who have hundreds of GPUs on hand at any given time to continuously tell people for the better part of like 2 years now that they're basically idiots for purchasing a new GPU. 

Its like they rather have the PC gaming market die vs ""giving in"" and buying from GPU manufacturers.

Earth to GN and everyone else. Gaming is becoming less and less of a profit driver for these companies, yeah lets just stop buying gaming GPUs until we have 5090tis at $399.

\---------------------

Key Points (TL;DW):

* RTX 4060 TI power consumption is lower compared to previous generations, following Nvidia's recent trajectories of relative performance to price.
* The 4060 TI consumes about 165 watts in a full (torture) workload, which is **40 watts lower than the prior 3060 TI** and **30 watts higher than the RX 6600**.
* Overclocking only adds 10 watts to the 4060 TI, indicating **limited overclocking headroom on the Founder's Edition**.
   * Partners could potentially improve overclocking capabilities, which might reduce the argument for upselling to higher-end cards.
* The **DLSS3 argument made by Nvidia is not sufficient** to justify the existence of the 4060 TI in this capacity.
* The **price-performance ratio of the 4060 TI is disappointing**, especially as prices are falling.
* The product name carries expectations, and **Nvidia's naming strategy lacks consideration** for buyer expectations.
* **Launching a card that performs similarly to the previous generation's** higher-end models at the same price is not good enough.
* The **16GB variant of the 4060 TI is unlikely to solve these issues**, although it may address texture loading problems in memory-intensive games.",PapaBePreachin,147,Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti,Graphics Processing Unit,2023-05-23 13:03:13

This card is a downgrade from it's predecessors in any meaningful way. 

The 3060ti was marketed as a 1440p card, the 4060ti is marketed as a 1080p card.

Their justification for 1080p is that according to the Steam Survey there are many 1080p gamers, but you have to question how many of those 1080p gamers are actively looking for new $400 cards. How many of them are laptop screens with no possibility to upgrade the graphics card anyway.

The 4060ti is [beaten in 4k in some games by the 3060ti](https://i.imgur.com/GUkRWrY.png), probably thanks to the 128bit bus and 8x interface clearly put there to choke the card, lest Nvidia accidentally create a bargain 4k card.

You know what other card had a 128bit bus and an 8x interface? The 3050. This is an xx50 class card.

The irony is that going forward, the 3060 is going to perform much the same as it always has for longer than the 3060ti and 4060ti will, thanks to it's 12gb ram.

----

A pre-emptive asterisk, yes I know that cores from different generations are not entirely comparable, and generational architecture uplift and all that, but in general, you can see the trend was upward.

If you think 8gb should still be just as viable, then why not 4gb, or my old 384mb GTX 260. The answer is at some point in order to move on, we need to increase requirements. We cannot for years have complained that console specs held our games back, then complain when the devs start taking advantage of the 16gb that's in consoles, where devs can easily allocate 10-12gb as vram.

Yes, it is $100 cheaper than the launch 3080 and you get +2GB of VRAM, but it's still bad when you take into account that technology is inherently supposed to improve over time. The Ada cards only seem reasonable if you agree with the official Nvidia (Jensen) quote “The idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past”.



If you blindly accept that a 3080 is ALWAYS going to cost $700 then the 4070 seems like a wicked deal since good guy Nvidia is saving you $100 despite the challenges...lol",dparks1234,120,Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070,Graphics Processing Unit,2023-04-12 13:09:28
jfyq1bk,t3_12jlrnp,"I think “solid, but unspectacular” is a good way to describe the 4070.

The release of the 3080 meant that all future cards will always be compared against it, and nothing in this price segment stacks up even 3 years on. The 3080 may go down as one of the best GPUs ever made, so it was always going to be an uphill battle for the 4070 to beat it. What we got was a card that’s just…okay. Not awful value, but nothing ground-breaking either. Just…okay.

But to be honest, there was no chance for Nvidia to do better than okay value, not without cutting into their already declining margins. I [previously did some napkin math](https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/129lfxd/_/jesxaue/?context=1) on how much it costs to make a 4070-class die, and the TLDR is that a 4070-class die costs as much, if not more, than a 3080-class die did 3 years ago. No joke, Nvidia saves *nothing* shrinking the 3080 into a smaller die size. It would be like if the GTX 1060 costed more to make than a GTX 970. 

This is because going from Samsung 8N to TSMC N4 is at least a *tripling* of the wafer price. At $16000+ per wafer, saving costs going from Ampere to Lovelace is almost impossible. It’s no surprise then that the 4070 has 3080 performance at a 3080 price.

Will Nvidia cut their margins to lower prices? I doubt it, given that ChatGPT came in just in time for the crypto gold rush to be replaced by another equally lucrative gold rush. That doesn’t mean that we should be happy that the 4070 costs $600. But given what the market is currently like, this is probably the best that we can hope for for now.",wizfactor,42,Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070,Graphics Processing Unit,2023-04-12 13:09:28

Nvidia wants you to look at it from the halo product pricing of the 3090's 24gb $1,499 and not little value brother that the $699 3080 10gb was. You start to realize the value is really bad when you are getting 20% more rasterization performance at an price increase of +14.3% and just 2gb more VRAM. Not 24 gb, not 16 gb, just 12gb. Nvidia has brought halo level pricing to the 4080 and 4070ti and should be called out for this. In the past, the xx70, xx80 series offer great performance and weren't poorly priced, and offered exceptional value against a Titan halo card. This new gen, the prices scaled with the previous generation in terms of performance/dollar, it feels like a continuation of the 3xxx gen honestly.

To be honest, while the value sucks and as I've been preaching for well over 2 years now vram limitations are a silly hill to die on (or be DOA on), this is at least an upgrade in terms of potential performance. Still nothing close to what it should be, but at least it's going to be a price that isn't extraordinarily egregious, rather just normal egregious.

jftobjb,t3_12idk6a,"Unpopular take: DLSS being generationally software locked is the future of gaming. Whether you like it or not. AI upscaling is going to take over native gameplay. It just is.

We're the ones living through the transition. So things like vram plateaus, memory bus stagnation or reduction, etc. stand out. In reality? It won't really matter in 5 years.

People are comparing raw performance figures between generations and thinking of how this translated to native gameplay. That's not what the industry is banking on long-term. They just aren't. Especially now that mining seems to be a thing of the past.

Generational changes in cards will be based more based on frame generation/DLSS improvements than hardware improvements. Tensor cores will take the front stage. Vram won't matter as much. Neither will bus widths.

IMO? So long as games continue to look better and perform better? Who cares. We might now, but not in 5 years. It's not apples to apples between 20 and 40 or 40 and above.

jcc019z,t3_11s1bid,"This is where console gaming edges out in front for me. When Sony releases a first party game (or MS for that matter) you can be sure the hardware you paid for is being used for maximum effect. 

I've been an everything gamer my whole life getting high end PC's and all the consoles at every cycle. My GPU's would always come with these awesome demos (some were downloaded) featuring insane cutting edge tech that wouldn't be used until two GPU's down the road in terms of actual gaming. I still remember one of the very first Radeon cards to show off depth of field effects with some hover police bike in the clouds and that Ruby girl in the early 2000's. Personally I don't often go back to replay my old games on PC just to see the performance difference with my new GPU. Sure, I'll do it the day of for kicks but by this time it's too late, I've already moved on to the next big thing. So from my perspective there is no value in playing my old games again with more performance, but that's just me. Maybe it's because I always try to be ready for the launch of whatever title of the day might be.

Right now my Ps5 is doing a much better job at impressing me with it's value proposition than my old system with a RTX 2070 Super (apparently Ps5 equivalent) ever could, which cost a heck of a lot more than a Ps5.

Before anyone comes in with the, ""But a computer can do other things..."" I've got 7 damn computers in my house which are all more than capable of running Blender, Photoshop, video editing, you name it. And a few with decent RTX GPUs.
