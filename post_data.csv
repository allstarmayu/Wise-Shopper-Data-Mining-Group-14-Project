17synze,Is Ryzen 7 7800x3D really that good?,https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/17synze/is_ryzen_7_7800x3d_really_that_good/,ro3rr,39,85,0.76,"I have seen that a higher cache, such as x3d, is better for games, especially for Rust and Escape from Tarkov, which are my main games. I have also read a blog from UserBenchmark that marks the glorification of this processor as a marketing campaign:

""Be wary of sponsored reviews with cherry-picked games that showcase the wins, ignore frame drops, and gloss over the losses. Also, watch out for AMD's army of Neanderthal social media accounts on Reddit, forums, and YouTube; they will be singing their praises as usual. AMD continues to develop 'Advanced Marketing' relationships with select YouTubers with the obvious aim of compensating for second-tier products with first-tier marketing.""

""Rational gamers have little reason to look further than the $300 i5-13600K, which offers comparable real-world gaming and better desktop performance at a fraction of the price.""

I just want a future-proof CPU that will run these two games at the absolute maximum. I'm also an FPS-over-graphics type of guy, so I'm willing to run at minimal settings at a maximum 2K resolution for highest FPS. I will be glad if someone with a higher understanding of this topic responds.",AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D,Processor,2023-11-11 17:01:47
18f5j13,Ryzen 7 7800X3D is the GOAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/18f5j13/ryzen_7_7800x3d_is_the_goat/,Mopar_63,530,267,0.91,"I do not know what voodoo AMD did with this chip but they need to go back and look at their other chips and make the change.

First this chip is designed to be and delivered on being a gaming BEAST. It punches way above it's weight class. I know it is not as powerful as other offerings for productivity work loads, but seriously it was not designed to be. This is a gaming chip first and foremost. Seeing benchmarks for work loads to me seem silly. It is made for gaming, benchmarking workloads for this chip is like seeing how a sports car does for towing. 

Second, the chip is a power efficiency MONSTER. Even under stress  testing, at stock settings I am pulling under 70 watts. That is INSANE, this much performance and it sips power. I see people talking about under-volting, WHY BOTHER? 

Third, cooling is dirt simple. You do not need an AIO or LARGE air cooler to keep this chip under control. Even under heavy work load (not it's typical use) a cooler like an L12S (which Noctua claimed cannot do this) is able to keep full speed and temps under throttle level. You move to the intended use of the chip, gaming and cooling is super simple. 

The 5800X3D might have been a major jump for designing a chip specifically for gaming but it is still power hungry and a bear to cool. The 7800X3D is nothing short of amazing on every level.

We see all the ""high end chips"" needing more power, more cooling and yet here is a chip priced in the mid range that is running as fast or FASTER while sipping juice and running cooler than a Jamaican Bobsled Team.

The games i play is cs2 (Counter-Strike) pubg and League. 

I dont really feel like it's crucial to upgrade but i'm kinda lacking some performance to get all the frames to my 240hz monitor.

But i can put live it if it's worth waiting for the next gen Ryzen. What i read it's coming Q2 2024. 

Specs right now
Nvidia 3070
I7 8700k
16gb ram

So i ordered it today, as you guys said. The next x3d can come late next year and i will prob not need it anyways. And now i got everything for 200$ discount.

Asus ROG Strix B650E-F gaming wifi
Corsair 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 6000MHz CL30 Vengeance

1ae09h8,Regarding the Ryzen 7800x3D performances overall,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1ae09h8/regarding_the_ryzen_7800x3d_performances_overall/,Symrai,115,118,0.89,"Hello here, I keep reading that this CPU might be the best CPU ever when it comes to GAMING, from the previous year, but it confuses me a bit.

By ""best CPU for gaming"", does that mean this CPU only shines for this specific use and will not be that impressive for anything else ? Like, for instance, streaming and gaming at the same time, having several softwares opened like a browser, several tabs in the browser, discord etc. and so on ?

It confuses me because sometimes people are comparing a Ryzen 7 7700x and the 7800x3D, and while the former seems to be also very good, most people tend to answer ""IF for gaming, 7800x3D hands down"". But by answering that way, does that mean the CPU is aimed for a user who's gonna only turn on his computer to launch a video game and nothing else ?

&#x200B;

I'm planning to make a new configuration since my current one is kinda old now (from 2017 : GTX 1070, i5 7600k, 16gb DDR4), and I would like to make it good for 1440p gaming but also for the general uses listed above... And the more I try to figure out which CPU might be good for the years to come, since I don't want to upgrade every generations, things have been a bit complicated for me especially with this Ryzen 7800x3D.

And by 1440p, I mean a 1440p with 165 hz (180 oc), and for the games it will mostly be fighting games (Tekken 8, Street Fighter 6), and maybe some RPG like Baldur's Gate 3, but maybe some others depending on what will be next !

What's appealing to me with the 7800x3D, beside its raw performances, is also its power usage, which seems to be far lower than its Intel counterparts and even from most of the others ryzen 7 CPUs.

&#x200B;

But for a user like me who likes to keep his configuration as long as possible, is this 7800x3D a good pick over a 7700x, or even over those Intel 13th/14th ones although their socket is at the end of its life?

- stock performance on default power limits, no overclocking
- only gaming benchmarks for real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks
- gaming benchmarks strictly at CPU limited settings, mostly at 720p or 1080p 1%/99th
- power consumption is strictly for the CPU (package) only, no whole system consumption
- ""RTL"" was used as an abbreviation for ""Raptor Lake"" because ""RPL"" can be misinterpreted (is also used by AMD for Zen 4 ""Raphael"")
- geometric mean in all cases
- gaming performance average is (good) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks
- MSRPs: from AMD's online shop (lower than official MSRP, but nearer market level), ""Recommended Customer Price"" on Intel for non-F models

On average of 19 launch reviews, the 7950X3D is still ahead of the 7800X3D by +1.2%. The rating of the reviews is by no means uniform, 7 see the 7800X3D in front, 11 the 7950X3D. Compared to the 13900K, the 7800X3D achieves an average lead of +3.0%. The verdict is not uniform here either: 6 reviews still favor the Intel processor, the other 13 then the AMD processor.

Generally, the 13900K, 13900KS, 7800X3D and 7950X3D are in the same performance sphere. The performance difference (from the smallest to the biggest model within this CPU group) is just 4%. The Ryzen 9 7900X3D, on the other hand, does not belong to this top group; it lags behind a bit more.

&nbsp;

8C: &nbsp; Ryzen 7 7700X &#8594; 7800X3D|+17.8%|+29% &nbsp;($349 vs $449)
12C:  Ryzen 9 7900X &#8594; 7900X3D|+10.6%|+33% &nbsp;($449 vs $599)
16C:  Ryzen 9 7950X &#8594; 7950X3D|+15.9%|+17% &nbsp;($599 vs $699)

Thus, the performance gain due to the extra 3D V-cache turns out to be the lowest on the Ryzen 9 7900X3D - despite the highest (nominal) additional price precisely on this model.

The application benchmarks from PCGH and Tom's are clearly multithread-heavy, only TPU has a complete benchmark set with many office and other benchmarks as well. The 7800X3D loses a bit more application performance than the 7950X3D - and is thus primary suitable as gaming CPU due to the higher price (compared to the 7700X).

The 13900K still needs an average of 143 watts under gaming, while the 7800X3D does the same job (with minimally better performance) on an average of only 56 watts. This is far **above twice the energy efficiency** in this particular comparison ([check as well the graph](https://www.3dcenter.org/abbildung/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-performance-zusammenfassung)).

Is this i solid and futureproof upgrade or should i just buy the standard version for 212 dollars less?

My goal:

Maybe for the next 4-5 years to be able to play all games in FHD or 2k resolution (by turning on dlss where it helps). Is this a good build? Vendor offered ASUS PRIME H610M-K 3200MHz DDR4 for cheaper price but pcpartpicker said it's not compatible with CPU so I upgraded the motherboard.

I'm also open to other builds and changes to my build that fit my goal. This is my first time building a pc. Thanks.

I need a many core system for VM workload. As always, I want a stable system, so I've bought a top motherboard, the largest AIO, XL size case, and a discrete GPU. Now as I've built it, I started testing and to my surprise I realized I could have spent 2/3 of the money having a nicer smaller PC. The CPU in Eco 105W mode achieves 90% of the total performance with peak power 170W. This is incredibly fast yet fits into an air cooled build. The built-in GPU is also very good for driving desktop. Unless you need a powerful GPU for gaming or other workload, the iGPU is more than enough. If I knew I would definitely plan to sacrifice the 10% of the CPU power but still have a solid 16 x 5GHz cores with HT. All would fit into a compact case, with quiet Noctua cooler, drawing max \~300W of power.  


As for the motherboard, I've heard a lot about the VRM efficiency, blah blah... in the end I strongly suspect the VRM efficiency of my motherboard is an overkill for the CPU, yet in the Eco 105 mode any board's VRM would be sufficient, so yeah, I could have paid half the price for mobo.",AMD Ryzen 9 7950X,Processor,2023-05-27 08:08:54

Building the PC was really fun! I enjoyed every moment of it. Even though it took months of planning and picking up parts, the sense of accomplishment is always satisfying. Here are some tips to recommend during the process :
 
- Plan your build before buying any components! Really take the time to do your research and watch a lot of creators content. The product sites could be very helpful to have an idea about the compatibility of elements!
- While building your PC please take your time. Don't rush things! I know wanting to fire up that baby for the first time could be really tempting but seriously just take your time! Always better be safe than sorry. Use gloves to avoid frying your components and handle them with care <3
- If you are stuck go back to the manual instructions shipped with every component! Everything you need is in there, again don't rush things rather do them right
- When firing up your PC for the first time if it doesn't post don't panic! Happened to me (Funny coming from someone who panicked like hell) just give it time if it doesn't turn the machine off and restart the process
- After getting your preferred operating system installed just take your time tweeking things the least you can do is turning on EXPO Profile for your RAM to OC it, Activate restore memory context to avoid heavy memory training on every post, and turn on PBO for free performance.
 
The PC is working like charm with some random crashes from now and then but nothing really flaggy. Last but not least seriously just have fun you gonna appreciate it :)",AMD Ryzen 9 7950X,Processor,2023-04-29 16:55:58
xvqypu,Does buying the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X make sense?,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/xvqypu/does_buying_the_amd_ryzen_9_7950x_make_sense/,Toni_Hoevedes,3,12,0.67,"I hope this post is correct for this subreddit and not for r/buildapcforme. I am not quite sure how to interpret rule 2. If it is wrong here just tell me and I will remove it :)

## TLDR

Does the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X make sense for a computer science student or is it totally unnecessary and stupid?

## Old gear

Right now I am using a very old PC (AMD FX 6350, GTX 960, DDR3 RAM, etc. ). I plan on upgrading for several years now and saved quite a lot for that. I was always waiting for the new Ryzen socket to appear, as I did not want to make the mistake again and buy the last generation of a current socket so I cannot upgrade later on (without switching the MoBo, RAM, PSU, etc. ).

## Question

Anyhow, now the new CPUs are out and I am wondering whether it makes sense to buy the Ryzen 9 7950X. I am a Computer Science student and compiling lots of programs (mainly Rust) but I also game a bit. In my opinion I do not really need such a powerful CPU but the other ones are not recommended to buy as much and the 7950X will last a looong time. Also, there is the feeling of having such a powerful CPU that it can do whatever you want basically instantly :)

## Possible new build

I will probably build a whole new PC and only reuse the GTX 960 for a while. If Nvidia brings out some cards which are not completely overpriced I might also look to buy one (also for Machine Learning tasks so unfortunately no AMD graphics card) but for now thats not the important part.

I put together a sample build and was wondering if it is in any way justified to buy the parts or if its total overkill / simply stupid in some way. Maybe also Intel is the right choice in the current market?

Hi, I recently built a pc with these specifications :-

1. AMD Ryzen 9 7950X
2. RTX 4090 Gigabyte Aero OC
3. NZXT Kraken Elite 360mm AIO
4. Asus ROG LOKI 1000watt PSU 80+Plat
5. Lian Li Sl120V2 Fans
6. Lian Li O11d Mini - Snow Edition
7. Teamgroup 6000MHZ 128GB RAM ( can only run it at 3600MHZ)
8. Asrock B650M Pro RS Wifi

So my question is related to the temperature of 7950x, What's your average cpu temps while idle, gaming etc. The temperature of my CPU while doing nothing stays quite a lot and usually stays a bit high, For example when I'm not doing anything, Just idle the CPU temperatures stay between 49-55-60(45-48 only when it's a fresh start, after some decent load it stays at 50+), and it fluctuates often, Mostly if I start my pc in the morning when things are usually not warm, it stays at 45-50 degrees but after playing games when I close the games, The temp doesn't go down much, it idles at 60-75 even while just browsing. The GPU temperature btw barely ever goes above 50 degrees.

Also when I do heavy rendering etc, stress tests the CPU temp i've never seen it crossing 86max, maybe 87 on 1-2 occasions but it usually stays at 85-86 at heavy blender rendering, While gaming it only goes to 85 when the game is loading up, etc otherwise its constant in between 60-75ish range while gaming on everything ""extreme"". So is this behavior of 7950x normal? Because I read that this processor is designed to run on high temps, But I don't know much because this was my first ever pc build. Let me know what you think of the temperatures and if i can reduce them down without changing anything related to voltage or underclocking etc( I'm not experienced in these things and it's costly so i don't want to fuck things up ). Also yea My pc doesn't boot up when i tried to increase ram frequency to anything above 3600MHZ ( 32gb x 4 - 128GB RAM 6000MHZ).",AMD Ryzen 9 7950X,Processor,2023-12-02 16:47:15

But the cpu was the biggest bottleneck, the leftover cpu was a ryzen 3 3100. I know that wont hold in today's world. So I thought of buying a new cpu, im already saving on other parts so. 

Is a ryzen 5 5600x sufficient for the current gaming market just so he can dip his toe in? I noticed that we are slowly moving to 8 core cpu requirements. Thats why I hesitate a little bit.

- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks
- geometric mean in all cases
- standard rasterizer performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS
- extra ray-tracing benchmarks after the standard rasterizer benchmarks
- stock performance on (usual) reference/FE boards, no overclocking
- factory overclocked cards _(results marked in italics)_ were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original result, just the index has been normalized)
- missing results were interpolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results
- performance average is (moderate) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks
- retailer prices and all performance/price calculations based on German retail prices of price search engine ""Geizhals"" on October 16, 2022
- for the full results plus (incl. power draw numbers) and some more explanations check [3DCenter's launch analysis](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090)

10ls9ma,Gigabyte Aorus Master RTX 4090 review,https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/10ls9ma/gigabyte_aorus_master_rtx_4090_review/,Mhmd1993,14,39,0.71,"Before buying this card several days ago, I found no proper reviews of it. Most focus on other models like the Gaming OC. So I'd like to share my experience with people who want to buy a 4090.

**The Pros:** The build quality is excellent, and there's absolutely no coil whine at all. 

The heatsink is quite massive. I think it's the biggest 4090 out there so far. This might be undesirable for some people, but in my opinion, it allows the card to stay cool with low levels of noise, and it's more reliable than water cooling. Make sure that the card fits in your case though, and you'll need an extra 15mm of clearance for the 12vhpwr connector to be plugged comfortably with a traditional horizontal mount.

My thermals and noise levels are outstanding. You can see Der8auer's thermals and tear down [in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc-zwQMV8-s) He was impressed with its cooling solution (aside from the stupid marketing). I made a custom fan curve to make it more silent, since it's unnecessarily loud by default. My thermals after a 1 hour stress test in [Bright Memory: infinite ray tracing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1409670/Bright_Memory_Infinite_Ray_Tracing_Benchmark/) benchmark:

GPU core: 64c

hotspot: <74c

mem: 68c

fan1: 62%, 1370 RPM

fan2: 63%, 1220 RPM

GPU load: 100% with 430w power draw

Case: nzxt h7 flow only with the stock 2 fans (intake fan adjusted to the lower slot)

Ambient temp: 15c

The [anti-sag bracket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSYodaliYGE) functions great, is relatively easy to install and keeps the aesthetics... however it blocked my case's front usb-c motherboard connector, which I don't mind all that much.

Warranty is 4 years, if you live in a country where you can deal with Gigabyte directly. I don't, so if I needed anything, I'll have to deal with the shop I bought the card from.

**The Cons**: I suffered through the infamous gigabyte fan revving problem. And although I did my research and asked on reddit, I only found about it after I bought the card. There was no fix online but I found that when disabling the RGB, the problem stops. It seems like the culprit is the LED on the fan blades. If you still want to fix this problem and keep the RGB, follow the steps in  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/10gu0x6/fixing_gigabytes_fan_revving_problem_on_the_rtx/), although your minimum RPM will be around 1200 RPM instead of 700, which is too much for lighter loads for a card with such cooling solution.

I don't care about RGB or the included LCD, but if you do, then you'll have a problem with the fans as I said before, and you'll have to deal with Gigabyte's awful software. It's beyond abysmal.

The LCD screen might have been useful for me to view the temperature and fan RPM, but it keeps showing the same numbers. You can put in a custom text, pic or a .GIF.

The size might also be a problem for you, as mentioned before.

**TL;DR:** Gorgeous card with a large but top class cooling solution, zero coil whine, broken software and RGB will probably cause fan revving. 

I would love to see it compared to the ROG Strix version.",Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090,Graphics Processing Unit,2023-01-26 13:51:57

14a2c6x,Powercolor Red Devil 7900 XTX User review,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/14a2c6x/powercolor_red_devil_7900_xtx_user_review/,_adam_p,7,69,0.56,"Hi all,

I found the reviews on this card a bit lacking, so I figured I should write my own. Hope it will be helpful to someone else, as I had my doubts about this purchase.

&#x200B;

**Rationale** (aka Why this card?)

Coming from a 6800 XT, which I loved I wanted to give RDNA3 a try, and switch to Nvidia if it is a bad experience. The choice was between the 7900 XT and the XTX. I have been waiting for a price drop, and this was the first card that met the mark, cost €1080.

(It is a great price considering I live in a country with 27% VAT)

I was aware of the possible issues, like high idle power usage, and the thermal paste and coil whine problem with this specific model. Figured I'd return it if it is bad.

&#x200B;

**Look & Feel**

The materials used are decent, in line with the quality of my TUF 6800 XT. The only card I ever had with better material usage was the MSI Suprim, and that is not much better.

Its 3.5 slots, thicc boi, but otherwise not oversized.

RGB is nice and strong, comes with an ARGB cable, which I haven't tried yet.

Comes with a decent bracket / holder.

The packaging is premium, not that it matters.

&#x200B;

**Temps & Noise**

Idle it sits around 45-60C, with the fans ocasionally kicking in, reducing the temps to 45C.

The start and stop is inaudible, they run at around 800 RPM, you can hear it if you really listen, but its nothing.

Idle power usage is TBP 60W with a 3440x1440 monitor @ 144Hz. Not great, not terrible. Definitely have to pay attention to turn off the system when not needed.

&#x200B;

During gaming I saw a max 78C on the edge, and 99C on the hotspot for a 21C delta. Pretty bad results. The test was concluded in a 25C room, so the results are in line with IgorsLab's testing **after** he fixed the paste issue. [He measured 95C in a 22C room](https://www.igorslab.de/en/powercolor-rx-7900xtx-red-devil-mit-eingebautem-herstellungsfehler-wenn-der-hotspot-zum-standard-wird/)

TBP is 375W under a 100% load, with fans running at a still very silent 1250 RPM, contributing to the high temps.

Raising the max fan speed to 70%, the fans turn at \~2200 RPM, and this results in a 9-10C drop in temperatures.

&#x200B;

Coil whine is suprisingly minimal. Best I have had in 5 years, and this pumps out the most FPS by far, so I was very happy to (not) hear that. Expected way worse.

&#x200B;

**OC & UV**

Ran everything fine with 1080mV, Cyberpunk crashed at 1050mV.

The clocks could be raised to 3150Mhz without crashing.

Overall, this netted a total of \~200Mhz, and a couple of FPS during gaming, without raising the power limit.

&#x200B;

**Nitpicks**

\- Marketing BS: ""Red Devil Never Bows""... yet for some reason they include a bracket. And indeed, without it, the card sags. Its not too bad, but definitely not something they should brag about.

\- The diffusor on the RGB strip allows the leds to shine through directly from some angles. If my PC is on the ground, I can see the individual leds.

&#x200B;

**Overall**

This is a flagship chip, and a flagsip model, so it should be judged at that level.

The build quality is excellent, but card sag caused by the lack of triangulation makes it only a passing grade, definitely not a good one.

The temps are very problematic. Using this card in the summer in a room without AC would be pretty much impossible, meaning the cooling is simply inadequate.

Verdict: Sent it back, will wait for the Nitro to drop. (costs €200 more still in my country)",AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX,Graphics Processing Unit,2023-06-15 13:22:24

As I found out, many people would not recommend an AMD for DCS / Il-2 or some serious flightsimming. It's not a surprise since 6000 series (for me) and 7000 series at launch underperformed by a lot (fixed now). Also, Nvidia has always had the next step in VR (and now with DLSS and RT).

  
Edit: some users said that they had no issues at launch with 6000 series. Must have been a user error on my end and my squad member's end.

I had a 4080 and I decided to give the 7900 XTX a chance.  The results surprised me. I did this review for Sheriff's Discord, so I will paste below. My specs are:

Mobo Asus ROG Maximus Hero Z790

CPU Intel Core I9 13900K @ 6.2 paired with a Asus Ryuo 360

Ram Corsair 64Gb @ 6000

PSU Corsair Hxi1500

Game on a NVME

Good case with good ventilation (Corsair 7000D with Arctic 140 Fans)

&#x200B;

*Summary tl dr -> The 7900 XTX is a beast of a card. It should fear nothing against the 4080. In rasterization, it's  a bit faster in DCS and Il-2. The first part of the efficience curve is really good and I may say even better than the 4080 with a slight undervolt?. Even in RT, the games that are plus 60fps in the Nvidia one will mostly reach 60fps too or get near it. No issue.  If I were interested only in RT games and using DLSS, then I would need to see if the Price increase (From 1000€ to 1300€) is justified.*

&#x200B;

Okay my brothers and sisters, here is a quick review. Tested various games, tested VR with Quest 3 a few moments ago and our beloved sims. The rest was yesterday all night long:  The model is the Sapphire Nitro +, one of the best air cooled XTX on the market. Sapphire is not EVGA, but it's one of the best AIBs around for AMD.  I've watched several videos these past few weeks and I think they don't do much justice or there are not many units availible.

First of all, I had NO issues with Drivers. Could record and do a mini stream no problem. I don't use more productivity programs besides Adobe, Vegas, MemoQ. For a normal content creator it works flawlesly. Even I could work with Discord (had trouble with streaming on my old 6700 XT Back in the day). Tried two monitors too and no shenanigans. Let me remind myself the moto: Don't buy tech too early. It has the newer HDMI and DP ports. For productivity tho, Nvidia is still the king. I am just making some YouTube videos. Take this into account!

It's not 100% slower in RT as others claimed. Probably 20 and 30% in some games. ([https://tpucdn.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx/images/relative-performance-rt\_3840-2160.png](https://tpucdn.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx/images/relative-performance-rt_3840-2160.png))I didn't have enough RT to try, but with Cyberpunk I was able to do RT + FSR at 4k and enjoy 60 fps.

The worst thing is the consumption. 400W on this Custom Nitro model is the norm and can be pushed up to 500W with a OC. And this is important. **The OC gives an uplift up to 10% in some cases (per some reviewers).**

&#x200B;

Both cards maxed like Watts, as the 4080 will pull north of 320W mark too. The worst case scenario for performance is with full Ray tracing where it takes a hit for the worst, but it's not that off from a lower 4000 series model.

Of course, using upscaling methods like FSR or Intel Xess or FG is mandatory with RT. The final results are probably between a 4070 and 4070ti with better 99% lows and tons of RAM to use. Enough for 60 fps gaming in RT and **AMD** ***CAN*** **do RT**. Even lower models I guess with FSR and this new FG with Unreal could be really cool.

FSR on the other part works good but it’s not as good as Nvidia’s DLSS. Also, this changes as soon as we go up in resolution. At 4k FSR performs  good enough to be a good contender, whereas at 1080p and even 2k the differences in edges, lines etc are worse. (Noticed this in RDR2) The differences at 4k are noticeable only if we focus on a single object. I tested both DCS, CyberPunk and DCS for this. From the online reviews, looks like FSR was like aids on your vision. I was surprised that at 4k works ""good enough"" and in many generations of GPUs. Good enough. I like it.

The metal construction of this model and the PCB seems of a really good quality. The backplate and ""joint"" in the back part prevent sagging and does a huge better job than the Gigabyte 4000 models. I think it's on the same way as the TUF and Asus ROG. Great! and great build quality.

It is shorter tan Gigabytes 4080 and weights 1kg less. I hope this also helps in sagging. It also comes with a support in the way of a lower part to attach. I have now two supports: this lower part and a pillar on the end of the GPU. The software is not needed and only helps you to change the RGB. You have 3 settings for BIOS. 1 OC 2 PW limited and 3 Software controlled.

I didn’t “fidget” with OC a lot with, but it has room to more OC. The temperature allows it: Temperature wise it’s good! Really good! 60 ºC average at máximum 400W so the cooler  it’s doing a great job and has margin to OC.   As expected, the efficiency drops soon at the last part. Until 80% of usage we are not reaching 200W, let alone 180W. it’s cool and good for that. Flying sims with a capped 80 or 100 fps result in less Wattage than in my old 4080 which did over 200W.

Let’s go to our beloved sims and FPS:  I fly with 100 or 80 fps, depending on the sim. I was using 80 in DCS an 100 in Il-2. After DCS got the MT upgrade I switched back to 100 in both.  For DCS in native, the card has NO issues with a 13900K. The fps reached 160 uncapped in the air and more than 100 in the ground. With the 4080 I was able to get 130-140 in the Hornet free flight mission. I had the best improvement in Marianas with tons of objects, specially with the Apache and all screens doing PIP. (VRAM was also going up and up, the 384 bits of bandwith help I guess?)

In this screenshot of Ah-64D Hot start on Syria I am using 3440x1400, MSAAx2, all maxed out, 1024 screens every frame (NO upscaling):

As you can see, I am hitting 75 fps with both screens showing content. I was not able to do this with my 4080 where I was barely hitting 60 fps withouth upscaling.

&#x200B;

In Il-2 I also had an improvement, maybe smaller. Could reach 144 in 344x1440 with MSAAx4 and all maxed out. I didnt get 144 in the 4080. More like 120-130.  With OC both sims showed a Little welcomed uplift, giving more % to the AMD one. Nvidia OC was boring AF and didn’t get me out much.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Both sims at 100 fps gave me a board power slightly higher than the 4080, but have more headroom.

&#x200B;

What in VR? How does it perform? I **WAS** surprised. I tested this card (other model) after launch here. In VR the 4080 was like 30% faster. I was surprised this was not the case anymore, will it be in the future?  In Il-2 I could fly with almost everything maxed out sans shadows and MSAA with the Quest 3. 90 fps no trobule dropping down with 16 planes in the air and a high cloud cover. I also had dips on my 4080 when planes were blocking the sky.  I am not sure how much of a decrease is in VR, but the performance was really similar between the two, so similar I could guess RAM and CPU OC matter more.

In DCS and using FSR also gave me headroom to play. Using the Viper refuel mission I was able to have the exact same settings albeit a little reduction on resolution (I found out later that it was the same, FSR was on, did a retest and didn't need to change settings from the 4080).  The 7900 XTX can do VR similar (maybe 5% less?) to a 4080 to this day in Il-2. **THIS is realy important**. I don't do VR so I can get you all of the juice, but some squad mamebers use it and they are happy. Would be great to have more people testing this.

&#x200B;

All in all, I didn’t have time to test more an the VR was a quick test. I didn’t have any issues neither on the setup with Virtual Desktop. Just plug in, adjust resolution and get the same as before and nothing more.  For a Price point of 999€ I think it’s a great card, considering it uses old-style connectors and non propietary Nvidia tech. The biggest downside I can see is conmsumption and RT, but being worse than a 4080 in RT doesn’t mean it can’t beat a normal 4070 in it.  What about OC? I applied it and I feel like the dips were lower. There is much to explore. As I said earlier, some OC test gave me some good uplift, I guess I can pull more.

I guess it had issues in special places, programs etc, because this thing is awesome. The 4080 cost me 1300€, this one 1050€. You can get other XTX for as Little as 999€ (Hellhound) and perform similar.

The best card in the world RN is the 4090, there is no doubts. Better raster and RT than anything else and special tech. Going down… the 4080 seems like a bad deal at the moment with 256 bus and 16 gb for a future proof.  (20 gb would have killed this AMD card)

Super cards probably might cause a lower Price here. Taking into accountscalpers and other factors, the 4070 TI Super may end in this same region whereas the 4080 Super (that probably will have head again in raster) in 1400 or more, whereas this might drop to 799 / 900€ in some models.

I need more time with it :) but this thing is interesting.

&#x200B;

The 4080 Super with 20gb could just kill this thing for 1300 but I guess we are forced to pay 2000€ and more for the 4090.

Kind regards,

1ahowiy,4070 Super Review for 1440p Gamers,https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1ahowiy/4070_super_review_for_1440p_gamers/,wookmania,297,452,0.83,"I play on 1440p/144hz. After spending sn eternity debating on a 4070 super or 4080 super, here are my thoughts. I budgeted $1100 for the 4080 super but got tired of waiting and grabbed a 4070S Founders Edition at Best Buy. I could always return it if the results were sub par. Here’s what I’ve learned:

- this card has “maxed”every game I’ve tried so far at a near constant 144 fps, even cyberpunk with a few tweaks. With DLSS quality and a mixture of ultra/high. With RT it’s around 115-120 fps. Other new titles are at ultra maxed with DLSS. Most games I’ve tried natively are running well at around 144 with all the high or ultra graphics settings. 

- It’s incredibly quiet, esthetic, small, and very very cool. It doesn’t get over 57 Celsius under load for me (I have noctua fans all over a large phanteks case for reference). 

- anything above a 4070 super is completely OVERKILL for 1440p IN MY OPINION*. It truly is guys. You do not need a higher card unless you play on 4k high FPS. My pal is running a 3080ti and gets 100 fps on hogwarts 4k, and it’s only utilizing 9GB VRAM.

- the VRAM controversy is incredibly overblown. You will not need more than 12GB 99.9% of the time on 1440p for a looong time. At least a few years, and by then you will get a new card anyway. If the rationale is that a 4080S or 4090 will last longer - I’m sure they will, but at a price premium, and those users will also have to drop settings when newer GPU’s and games come out. I’ve been buying graphics cards for 30 years - just take my word for it.

In short if you’re on the fence and want to save a lot of hundreds, just try the 4070 super out. The FE is amazingly well built and puts the gigabyte wind force to shame in every category - I’ve owned several of them.

Take the money you saved and trade in later for a 5070/6070 super and you’ll be paying nearly the same cost as one of the really pricy cards now. It’s totally unnecessary at 1440p and this thing will kick ass for a long time. You can always return it as well, but you won’t after trying it. 2c

My previous GPU was the Gigabyte RX 5700 XT OC, so I'm mostly comparing my experience to that.

Physically, the card is quite a bit heftier, the backplate feels very solid.

You only get the card in the box, no holders or (thank goodness) driver CDs or anything. I got the Starfield code in an e-mail by the shop and it worked flawlessly and indeed gave me the premium edition (I've seen some confusion about that since many shops just list the standard one).

Now, my biggest reason for upgrading was the temps on the 5700 XT which were simply outrageous at times.

The attached screenshot is a HWInfo snapshot after 15 solid minutes of FurMark torture in 3840 x 1600. While the 5700 XT's hotspot would go straight to 110 or even 115 degrees (no matter the fan settings), this card stayed relatively cool and quiet - and I have to add that my case has a pretty terrible airflow, it's the Corsair Crystal 280X. The 90 on the hotspot is still a little high, but much better than before. And, of course, FurMark is about as high a load as you'll ever put on your GPU, so gaming should be just fine.

I used the automatic undervolt settings in Adrenaline, will try to tweak them later.

In any case, if you like the looks of this model and were wondering whether you should go for it, my first impression is that it's definitely one of the good ones.

Hope that helps. If you'd like me to do some more tests with it, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

Temperatures and clock speeds? Its quite hot where i live around 32C+ usually. So yeah getting it because 6800XT seems outa budget and im kinda blown off on my RTX 3070 dying out randomly so I don't find it justified to spend anymore now honestly.
Its costing me around 255$ on used market.

I can see AMD prices going down (I guess from general market and recent Nvidia news).

My 6700 XT caught my eyes, as I can see it’s better than 3060 and comparable with 3070. Also I can buy it for around £340-£390.

What are your general thoughts on the card? I can see pretty poor/average reviews but this was done a year ago where I’m sure they factored in price to performance.

I’ll most likely play 1440p gaming, as my monitor is not 4k, and I have a Ryzen 5600x CPU so I want to utilise Smart Memory Access",AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT,Graphics Processing Unit,2022-09-25 09:42:03

- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks
- geometric mean in all cases
- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS
- extra ray-tracing benchmarks after the standard raster benchmarks
- stock performance on (usual) reference/FE boards, no overclocking
- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original result, just the index has been normalized)
- missing results were interpolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results
- performance average is (some) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks
- all reviews should have used newer drivers, especially with nVidia (not below 521.90 for RTX30)
- MSRPs specified with price at launch time
- current retailer prices according to Geizhals (DE/Germany) and Newegg (U.S.) for immediately available offers
- for the full results and some more explanations check [3DCenter's launch analysis](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070)

The same conclusion is reached as with 4080 & 4070Ti: They are good cards, but the price and performance/price ratio sorely miss a generational leap. RTX40 now looks more like [a refresh of Ampere](https://www.3dcenter.org/abbildung/performancepreis-verhaeltnisse-geforce-rtx-30-vs-rtx-40-v2), like the [""SUPER"" refresh for Turing](https://www.3dcenter.org/abbildung/performancepreis-verhaeltnisse-geforce-1620-vs-geforce-1620-super) - instead of a new generation, like [from Maxwell to Pascal](https://www.3dcenter.org/abbildung/performancepreis-verhaeltnisse-geforce-900-vs-geforce-10).

- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks
- geometric mean in all cases
- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS
- extra ray-tracing benchmarks after the standard raster benchmarks
- stock performance on (usual) reference/FE boards, no overclocking
- factory overclocked cards _(results marked in italics)_ were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original result, just the index has been normalized)
- missing results were interpolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results
- performance average is (moderate) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks
- all reviews should have used newer drivers, especially with nVidia (not below 521.90 for RTX30)
- MSRPs specified with price at launch time
- for the full results (incl. test systems, driver versions, power draw numbers, performance/price ratios) and some more explanations check [3DCenter's launch analysis](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti)

A factory overclocked variant was used for the 4070Ti in about half of the evaluated test reports. However, the effect of the factory overclocking is conspicuously low in this graphics card: None of them achieves more than a performance gain of +1% - regardless of whether it starts with only +60 MHz offset at boost clock or with +150 MHz. Apparently, the TDP of 285 watts, which is also observed in the factory overclocked variants, is the first limitation. The performance effect of factory overclocked cards is therefore marginal for the 4070Ti, which means that a (possible) error rate after interpolation to the reference clock is even smaller.

Personal opinion:    
The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is just as disappointing as the GeForce RTX 4080 from the graphics card market's point of view. Even the fact that the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti was immediately available at the MSRP at launch day can't fix this. What is missing is a clear incentive to buy - especially in a performance class, which was already occupied by the predecessor generation. nVidia may have lowered the price point a bit between the change from ""GeForce RTX 4080 12GB"" to ""GeForce RTX 4070 Ti"", but the basic problem of this graphics card generation has not been solved: A generational leap, which is expressed in a clearly better performance/price ratio, is missing.

12pc774,"Damn, I bought a rtx 4070 msi ventus x3",https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/12pc774/damn_i_bought_a_rtx_4070_msi_ventus_x3/,mecomes,12,92,0.63," Hello people, I bought the new rtx 4070 the day of the launch and everything was going great, it has the same price as the FE and I like its design. 

The problem comes when yesterday I see the review of Igor labs [https://www.igorslab.de/en/geforce-rtx-4070-brought-to-the-price-point-when-the-compulsion-to-uvp-defeats-reason/2/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/geforce-rtx-4070-brought-to-the-price-point-when-the-compulsion-to-uvp-defeats-reason/2/)

I realized that is my gpu, the msi ventus x3. I started to investigate more and I also found the review of Guru3d [https://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/msi-geforce-rtx-4070-ventus-3x-review,7.html](https://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/msi-geforce-rtx-4070-ventus-3x-review,7.html)

To make the gpu cheaper, they skimped on cooling, thermal pads are missing. I got worried and started stressing my gpu with furmark, and the hotpoint doesn't increase more than 86-87. I managed to reach 92.7º at the hotpoint with the passmark test, and that is short stress. In the reviews they go even higher.

Now I'm thinking about returning the GPU, but the alternatives for the same price are the gigabyte wf(discarded) and the zotac trinity.

Although I also think that if I use the PC for gaming, I shouldn't worry so much about the temperatures damaging my graphics in a few years. What would you do?

11s1bid,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Rumored to Launch at $749,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/11s1bid/nvidia_geforce_rtx_4070_rumored_to_launch_at_749/,Zhukov-74,491,218,0.93,"According to the latest rumor coming from Moore's Law is Dead, the upcoming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 could have a higher MSRP than expected, and could launch at $749. Yesterday, [another rumor pointed out that NVIDIA is splitting the reviews for the GeForce RTX 4070 on two dates](https://www.techpowerup.com/305930/nvidia-plans-different-review-post-dates-for-msrp-and-non-msrp-geforce-rtx-4070), with reference models that are sticking to MSRP going out on April 12th, and custom, higher-priced versions, a day later, on April 13th. The same date, April 13th, is when the GeForce RTX 4070 should hit retail shelves.

According to Moore's Law is Dead, the MSRP for reference versions will be set at $749.99, which is a bit more than earlier expected, and just $50 less than the launch MSRP for the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti. The custom versions, or ""premium"" as some now called them, could start at $799.99.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 is also based on the AD104 GPU, as the RTX 4070 Ti, but has 46 streaming multiprocessors (SMs), leaving it with 5,888 CUDA cores enabled. On the other hand, it is rumored to come with the same memory configuration as the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti, featuring 12 GB of 21 Gbps GDDR6X memory on a 192-bit memory interface. The TGP is set at 200 W.

The performance is expected to land somewhere between the RTX 3080 Ti and the RTX 3080, or pretty much in line with the RX 6900 XT. Of course, a 50% bump in the launch price compared to the predecessor, the RTX 3070, leaves a rather sour taste.
